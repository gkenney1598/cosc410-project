Phenylephrine,"Why is this medication prescribed? Phenylephrine is used to relieve nasal discomfort caused by colds, allergies, and hay fever. It is also used to relieve sinus congestion and pressure. Phenylephrine will relieve symptoms but will not treat the cause of the symptoms or speed recovery. Phenylephrine is in a class of medications called nasal decongestants. It works by reducing swelling of the blood vessels in the nasal passages. How should this medicine be used? Phenylephrine comes as a tablet, a liquid, or a dissolving strip to take by mouth. It is usually taken every 4 hours as needed. Follow the directions on your prescription label or the package label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take phenylephrine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor or directed on the label. Phenylephrine comes alone and in combination with other medications. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice on which product is best for your symptoms. Check nonprescription cough and cold product labels carefully before using two or more products at the same time. These products may contain the same active ingredient(s) and taking them together could cause you to receive an overdose. This is especially important if you will be giving cough and cold medications to a child. Nonprescription cough and cold combination products, including products that contain phenylephrine, can cause serious side effects or death in young children. Do not give these products to children younger than 4 years of age. If you give these products to children 4 to 11 years of age, use caution and follow the package directions carefully. If you are giving phenylephrine or a combination product that contains phenylephrine to a child, read the package label carefully to be sure that it is the right product for a child of that age. Do not give phenylephrine products that are made for adults to children. Before you give a phenylephrine product to a child, check the package label to find out how much medication the child should receive. Give the dose that matches the child's age on the chart. Ask the child's doctor if you don't know how much medication to give the child. If you are taking the liquid, do not use a household spoon to measure your dose. Use the measuring spoon or cup that came with the medication or use a spoon made especially for measuring medication. If your symptoms do not get better within 7 days or if you have a fever, stop taking phenylephrine and call your doctor. If you are taking the dissolving strips, place one strip on your tongue and allow it to dissolve.

Pyrethrin and Piperonyl Butoxide Topical,"Why is this medication prescribed? Pyrethrin and piperonyl butoxide shampoo is used to treat lice (small insects that attach themselves to the skin on the head, body, or pubic area ['crabs']) in adults and children 2 years of age and older. Pyrethrin and piperonyl butoxide is in a class of medications called pediculicides. It works by killing lice. How should this medicine be used? Pyrethrin and piperonyl butoxide comes as a shampoo to apply to the skin and hair. It is usually applied to the skin and hair in two or three treatments. The second treatment must be applied 7-10 days after the first one. Sometimes a third treatment may be necessary, as recommended by your doctor. Follow the directions on your prescription label or the package label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use pyrethrin and piperonyl butoxide shampoo exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than directed on the package label or prescribed by your doctor. The package label gives you an estimate of how much shampoo you will need based on your hair length. Be sure to use enough shampoo to cover all of your scalp area and hair. Pyrethrin and piperonyl butoxide shampoo should only be used on the skin or hair and scalp. Avoid getting pyrethrin and piperonyl butoxide shampoo in your eyes, nose, mouth, or vagina. Do not use it on your eyebrows or eyelashes. If pyrethrin and piperonyl butoxide shampoo gets in your eyes, flush them with water right away. If your eyes are still irritated after flushing with water, call your doctor or get medical help right away. To use the shampoo, follow these steps: Shake the shampoo well right before use to mix the medication evenly. Use a towel to cover your face and eyes. Be sure to keep your eyes closed during this treatment. You may need to have an adult help you apply the shampoo. Apply pyrethrin and piperonyl butoxide shampoo to your dry hair and scalp area or skin. If you have head lice, begin to apply the shampoo behind your ears and at the back of your neck and then cover all of the hair on your head and scalp. Keep the shampoo on for 10 minutes, but no longer. You should use a timer or clock to track the time. After 10 minutes, use a small amount of warm water to form a lather and shampoo as usual. Rinse your hair and scalp or skin thoroughly with warm water. If you have head lice, dry your hair with a towel and comb out tangles.

These infections may need to be treated in a hospital and may cause death. Tell your doctor if you often get any type of infection or if you have or think you may have any type of infection now. This includes minor infections (such as open cuts or sores), infections that come and go (such as cold sores) or chronic infections that do not go away. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had any condition that affects your immune system or if you live or have ever lived in areas such as the Ohio or Mississippi river valleys where severe fungal infections are more common. Ask your doctor if you don't know if these infections are more common in your area. Tell your doctor if you are taking medications that decrease the activity of the immune system.

Adalimumab injection comes as a solution (liquid) in single-dose, prefilled syringes, prefilled dosing pens, prefilled automatic injection devices, and vials to inject subcutaneously (under the skin).
Your doctor will tell you how often to use adalimumab based on your condition and age. To help you remember to inject adalimumab injection, mark the days you are scheduled to inject the drug on your calendar.

You can inject adalimumab injection anywhere on the front of your thighs or stomach except your navel (belly button) and the area 2 inches (5 centimeters) around it. To reduce the chances of soreness or redness, use a different site for each injection. Give each injection at least 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) away from a spot that you have already used. Keep a list of the places where you have given injections so that you will not inject in these places again. Do not inject into an area where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard or where you have scars or stretch marks. Always look at adalimumab injection solution before injecting it. Check that the expiration date has not passed and that the syringe, dosing pen, or automatic injection device contains the correct amount of liquid.
Check with the written instructions for use to find out what your adalimumab injection solution should look like.

Isotretinoin,"IMPORTANT WARNING: For all patients: Isotretinoin must not be taken by patients who are pregnant or who may become pregnant. There is a high risk that isotretinoin will cause loss of the pregnancy, or will cause the baby to be born too early, to die shortly after birth, or to be born with birth defects (physical problems that are present at birth). A program called iPLEDGE has been set up to make sure that pregnant women do not take isotretinoin and that women do not become pregnant while taking isotretinoin. All patients, including women who cannot become pregnant and men, can get isotretinoin only if they are registered with iPLEDGE, have a prescription from a doctor who is registered with iPLEDGE and fill the prescription at a pharmacy that is registered with iPLEDGE. Do not buy isotretinoin over the internet. You will receive information about the risks of taking isotretinoin and must sign an informed consent sheet stating that you understand this information before you can receive the medication. You will need to see your doctor every month during your treatment to talk about your condition and the side effects you are experiencing. At each visit, your doctor may give you a prescription for up to a 30-day supply of medication with no refills. If you are a woman who can become pregnant, you will also need to have a pregnancy test in an approved lab each month and have your prescription filled and picked up within 7 days of your pregnancy test. If you are a man or if you are a woman who cannot become pregnant, you must have this prescription filled and picked up within 30 days of your doctor visit. Your pharmacist cannot dispense your medication if you come to pick it up after the allowed time period has passed. Tell your doctor if you do not understand everything you were told about isotretinoin and the iPLEDGE program or if you do not think you will be able to keep appointments or fill your prescription on schedule every month. Your doctor will give you an identification number and card when you start your treatment. You will need this number to fill your prescriptions and to get information from the iPLEDGE website and phone line. Keep the card in a safe place where it will not get lost. If you do lose your card, you can ask for a replacement through the website or phone line. Do not donate blood while you are taking isotretinoin and for 1 month after your treatment. Do not share isotretinoin with anyone else, even someone who has the same symptoms that you have. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with isotretinoin and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( https://www.fda.gov/Drugs ), the manufacturer's website, or the iPLEDGE program website ( http://www.ipledgeprogram.com ) to obtain the Medication Guide. Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking isotretinoin. For female patients: If you can become pregnant, you will need to meet certain requirements during your treatment with isotretinoin. You need to meet these requirements even if you have not started menstruating (having monthly periods) or have had a tubal ligation ('tubes tied'; surgery to prevent pregnancy). You may be excused from meeting these requirements only if you have not menstruated for 12 months in a row and your doctor says you have passed menopause (change of life) or you have had surgery to remove your uterus and/or both ovaries. If none of these are true for you, then you must meet the requirements below. You must use two acceptable forms of birth control for 1 month before you begin to take isotretinoin, during your treatment and for 1 month after your treatment. Your doctor will tell you which forms of birth control are acceptable and will give you written information about birth control. You can also have a free visit with a doctor or family planning expert to talk about birth control that is right for you. You must use these two forms of birth control at all times unless you can promise that you will not have any sexual contact with a male for 1 month before your treatment, during your treatment, and for 1 month after your treatment. If you choose to take isotretinoin, it is your responsibility to avoid pregnancy for 1 month before, during, and for 1 month after your treatment. You must understand that any form of birth control can fail. Therefore, it is very important to decrease the risk of accidental pregnancy by using two forms of birth control at all times. Tell your doctor if you do not understand everything you were told about birth control or you do not think that you will be able to use two forms of birth control at all times. If you plan to use oral contraceptives (birth control pills) while taking isotretinoin, tell your doctor the name of the pill you will use. Isotretinoin interferes with the action of micro-dosed progestin ('minipill') oral contraceptives (Ovrette, Micronor, Nor-QD). Do not use this type of birth control while taking isotretinoin. If you plan to use hormonal contraceptives (birth control pills, patches, implants, injections, rings, or intrauterine devices), be sure to tell your doctor about all the medications, vitamins, and herbal supplements you are taking. Many medications interfere with the action of hormonal contraceptives. Do not take St. John's wort if you are using any type of hormonal contraceptive. You must have two negative pregnancy tests before you can begin to take isotretinoin. Your doctor will tell you when and where to have these tests. You will also need to be tested for pregnancy in a laboratory each month during your treatment, when you take your last dose and 30 days after you take your last dose. You will need to contact the iPLEDGE system by phone or the internet every month to confirm the two forms of birth control you are using and to answer two questions about the iPLEDGE program. You will only be able to continue to get isotretinoin if you have done this, if you have visited your doctor to talk about how you are feeling and how you are using your birth control and if you have had a negative pregnancy test within the past 7 days. Stop taking isotretinoin and call your doctor right away if you think you are pregnant, you miss a menstrual period, or you have sex without using two forms of birth control. If you become pregnant during your treatment or within 30 days after your treatment, your doctor will contact the iPLEDGE program, the manufacturer of isotretinoin, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). You will also talk with a doctor who specializes in problems during pregnancy who can help you make choices that are best for you and your baby. Information about your health and your baby's health will be used to help doctors learn more about the effects of isotretinoin on unborn babies. For male patients: A very small amount of isotretinoin will probably be present in your semen when you take prescribed doses of this medication. It is not known if this small amount of isotretinoin may harm the fetus if your partner is or becomes pregnant. Tell your doctor if your partner is pregnant, plans to become pregnant, or becomes pregnant during your treatment with isotretinoin. Why is this medication prescribed? Isotretinoin is used to treat severe recalcitrant nodular acne (a certain type of severe acne) that has not been helped by other treatments, such as antibiotics. Isotretinoin is in a class of medications called retinoids. It works by slowing the production of certain natural substances that can cause acne. How should this medicine be used? Isotretinoin comes as a capsule to take by mouth. Isotretinoin is usually taken twice a day with meals for 4 to 5 months at a time. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take isotretinoin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the capsules whole with a full glass of liquid. Do not chew, crush, or suck on the capsules. Your doctor will probably start you on an average dose of isotretinoin and increase or decrease your dose depending on how well you respond to the medication and the side effects you experience. Follow these directions carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure how much isotretinoin you should take. It may take several weeks or longer for you to feel the full benefit of isotretinoin. Your acne may get worse during the beginning of your treatment with isotretinoin. This is normal and does not mean that the medication is not working. Your acne may continue to improve even after you finish your treatment with isotretinoin.

Fentanyl,"Notice: Fentanyl buccal and sublingual products have been discontinued in the US. Because this drug is no longer available in the US market, the material in this monograph is no longer updated. If this drug is used in countries other than the U.S., it is essential that the manufacturersâ labeling be consulted for more recently available information. IMPORTANT WARNING: Fentanyl may be habit forming, especially with prolonged use. Use fentanyl exactly as directed. Do not use a larger dose of fentanyl, use the medication more often, or use it for a longer period of time than prescribed by your doctor.
While using fentanyl, discuss with your health care provider your pain treatment goals, length of treatment, and other ways to manage your pain. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family drinks or has ever drunk large amounts of alcohol, uses or has ever used street drugs, or has overused prescription medications, or has had an overdose, or if you have or have ever had mental problems such as depression, schizophrenia (a mental illness that causes disturbed or unusual thinking, loss of interest in life, and strong or inappropriate emotions), or hallucinations (seeing things or hearing voices that do not exist). There is a greater risk that you will overuse fentanyl if you have or have ever had any of these conditions. Talk to your health care provider immediately and ask for guidance if you think that you have an opioid addiction or call the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-HELP .

If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment: slowed breathing, long pauses between breaths, or shortness of breath. Fentanyl should only be prescribed by doctors who are experienced in treating pain in cancer patients. It should be used only to treat breakthrough cancer pain (sudden episodes of pain that occur despite around-the-clock treatment with pain medication) in cancer patients at least 18 years of age (or at least 16 years of age if using Actiq Â® brand lozenges) who are taking regularly scheduled doses of another narcotic (opiate) pain medication, and who are tolerant (used to the effects of the medication) to narcotic pain medications.
This medication should not be used to treat pain other than chronic cancer pain, especially short-term pain such as migraines or other headaches, pain from an injury, or pain after a medical or dental procedure.
Fentanyl may cause serious breathing problems or death if it is used by people who are not being treated with other narcotic medications or who are not tolerant to narcotic medications. Fentanyl may cause serious harm or death if used accidentally by a child or by an adult who has not been prescribed the medication. Even partially used fentanyl may contain enough medication to cause serious harm or death to children or other adults.
Keep fentanyl out of reach of children, and if you are using the lozenges, ask your doctor how to obtain a kit from the manufacturer containing child safety locks and other supplies to prevent children from getting the medication. Dispose of partially used lozenges according to the manufacturer's directions immediately after you remove them from your mouth. If fentanyl is used by a child or an adult who has not been prescribed the medication, try to remove the medication from the person's mouth and get emergency medical help. Taking certain medications with fentanyl may increase the risk that you will develop serious or life-threatening breathing problems, sedation, or coma.

Be sure that your caregiver or family members know which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor or emergency medical care if you are unable to seek treatment on your own. Fentanyl comes as two different transmucosal products and several other types of products.
The medication in each product is absorbed differently by the body, so one product cannot be substituted for any other fentanyl product.
If you are switching from one product to another, your doctor will prescribe a dose that is best for you. A program has been set up for each fentanyl product to decrease the risk of using the medication.
Your doctor will need to enroll in the program in order to prescribe fentanyl and you will need to have your prescription filled at a pharmacy that is enrolled in the program.
As part of the program, your doctor will talk with you about the risks and benefits of using fentanyl and about how to safely use, store, and dispose of the medication. After you talk with your doctor, you will sign a form acknowledging that you understand the risks of using fentanyl and that you will follow your doctor's instructions to use the medication safely.
Your doctor will give you more information about the program and how to get your medication and will answer any questions you have about the program and your treatment with fentanyl. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. If you use fentanyl regularly during your pregnancy, your baby may experience life-threatening withdrawal symptoms after birth.

Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication. Why is this medication prescribed? Fentanyl is used to treat breakthrough pain (sudden episodes of pain that occur despite round the clock treatment with pain medication) in cancer patients at least 18 years of age (or at least 16 years of age if using Actiq Â® brand lozenges) who are taking regularly scheduled doses of another narcotic (opiate) pain medication, and who are tolerant (used to the effects of the medication) to narcotic pain medications.
Fentanyl is in a class of medications called narcotic (opiate) analgesics. It works by changing the way the brain and nervous system respond to pain. Fentanyl should be used along with your other pain medication(s). Do not stop taking your other pain medication(s) when you begin your treatment with fentanyl. If you stop taking your other pain medication(s) you will need to stop using fentanyl. How should this medicine be used? Fentanyl comes as a lozenge on a handle, a sublingual (underneath the tongue) tablet, and a buccal (between the gum and cheek) tablet to dissolve in the mouth.
Fentanyl is used as needed to treat breakthrough pain but not more often than four times a day.
Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of fentanyl and gradually increase your dose until you find the dose that will relieve your breakthrough pain.
If you still have pain after using one lozenge or tablet, your doctor may tell you to use a second lozenge or tablet.
You may use the second lozenge (Actiq Â® ) 15 minutes after you finish the first lozenge, or use the second tablet (Fentora Â® ) 30 minutes after you started using the first tablet.
After you treat an episode of pain using 1 or 2 doses of fentanyl as directed, you must wait at least 4 hours after using fentanyl lozenge or tablet before treating another episode of breakthrough cancer pain.
Talk to your doctor about how well the medication is working and whether you are experiencing any side effects so that your doctor can decide whether your dose should be adjusted. Tell your doctor if you feel that your pain is not controlled or if your pain increases, becomes worse, or if you have new pain or an increased sensitivity to pain during your treatment with oxycodone. Do not take more of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Do not use fentanyl more than four times a day.
Call your doctor if you experience more than four episodes of breakthrough pain per day or if you have new pain or an increased sensitivity to pain during your treatment with fentanyl.
Your doctor may need to adjust the dose of your other pain medication(s) to better control your pain. Do not stop using fentanyl without talking to your doctor. Your doctor may decrease your dose gradually. If you suddenly stop using fentanyl, you may experience unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. To use fentanyl lozenges (Actiq Â® ), follow these steps: Check the blister package and the handle of the lozenge to make sure the lozenge contains the dose of medication you have been prescribed. Use scissors to cut open the blister package and remove the lozenge. Do not open the blister package until you are ready to use the medication. Place the lozenge in your mouth, between your cheek and gum. Actively suck on the lozenge, but do not chew, crush, or bite it. Move the lozenge around in your mouth, from one side to the other, using the handle. Twirl the handle often. Do not eat or drink anything while the lozenge is in your mouth. Finish the lozenge in about 15 minutes. If you begin to feel dizzy, very sleepy, or nauseated before you have finished the lozenge, remove it from your mouth. Dispose of it immediately as described below or put it in the temporary storage bottle for later disposal. If you finish the entire lozenge, throw the handle away in a garbage can that is out of the reach of children. If you did not finish the entire lozenge, hold the handle under hot running water to dissolve all the medication, and then throw the handle away in a garbage can that is out of the reach of children and pets. To use fentanyl sublingual and buccal tablets, follow these steps: Separate one blister unit from the blister card by tearing along the perforations. Peel back the foil to open the blister unit. Do not try to push the tablet through the foil. Do not open the blister unit until you are ready to use the tablet. Place the tablet in your mouth above one of your upper back teeth between your cheek and your gum or under your tongue as far back as you can. Leave the tablet in place until it dissolves completely. It may take 14 to 25 minutes for the tablet to dissolve. Do not split, chew, bite, or suck the tablet; do not swallow the tablet whole. If any of the tablet is left in your mouth after 30 minutes, swallow it with a drink of water. If you begin to feel dizzy, very sleepy, or nauseated before the tablet dissolves, rinse your mouth with water and spit the remaining pieces of tablet into the sink or toilet. Flush the toilet or rinse the sink to wash away the tablet pieces.

Albuterol Oral Inhalation,"Why is this medication prescribed? Albuterol is used to prevent and treat difficulty breathing, wheezing, shortness of breath, coughing, and chest tightness caused by lung diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; a group of diseases that affect the lungs and airways). Albuterol inhalation aerosol and powder for oral inhalation is also used to prevent breathing difficulties during exercise. Albuterol inhalation aerosol (Proair HFA, Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA) is used in adults and children 4 years of age and older. Albuterol powder for oral inhalation (Proair Respiclick) is used in children 12 years of age and older. Albuterol solution for oral inhalation is used in adults and children 2 years of age and older. Albuterol is in a class of medications called bronchodilators. It works by relaxing and opening air passages to the lungs to make breathing easier. How should this medicine be used? Albuterol comes as a solution (liquid) to inhale by mouth using a special jet nebulizer (machine that turns medication into a mist that can be inhaled) and as an aerosol or powder to inhale by mouth using an inhaler. When the inhalation aerosol or powder for oral inhalation is used to treat or prevent symptoms of lung disease, it is usually used every 4 to 6 hours as needed. When the inhalation aerosol or powder for oral inhalation is used to prevent breathing difficulty during exercise, it is usually used 15 to 30 minutes before exercise. The nebulizer solution is usually used three or four times a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use albuterol exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Call your doctor if your symptoms worsen or if you feel that albuterol inhalation no longer controls your symptoms. If you were told to use albuterol as needed to treat your symptoms and you find that you need to use the medication more often than usual, call your doctor. Albuterol controls symptoms of asthma and other lung diseases but does not cure them. Do not stop using albuterol without talking to your doctor. Each albuterol aerosol inhaler is designed to provide 60 or 200 inhalations, depending on its size. Each albuterol powder inhaler is designed to provide 200 inhalations. After the labeled number of inhalations has been used, later inhalations may not contain the correct amount of medication. Dispose of the aerosol inhaler after you have used the labeled number of inhalations, even if it still contains some liquid and continues to release a spray when it is pressed. Dispose of the powder inhaler 13 months after you open the foil wrapper, after the expiration date on the package, or after you have used the labeled number of inhalation, whichever comes first. Your inhaler may come with an attached counter that keeps track of the number of inhalations you have used. The counter also tells you when to call your doctor or pharmacist to refill your prescription and when there are no inhalations left in the inhaler. Read the manufacturer's instructions to learn how to use the counter. If you have this type of inhaler, you should not try to change the numbers or remove the counter from the inhaler. If your inhaler does not come with an attached counter, you will need to keep track of the number of inhalations you have used. You can divide the number of inhalations in your inhaler by the number of inhalations you use each day to find out how many days your inhaler will last. Do not float the canister in water to see if it still contains medication. The inhaler that comes with albuterol aerosol is designed for use only with a canister of albuterol. Never use it to inhale any other medication, and do not use any other inhaler to inhale albuterol. Be careful not to get albuterol inhalation into your eyes. Do not use your albuterol inhaler when you are near a flame or source of heat. The inhaler may explode if it is exposed to very high temperatures. Before you use albuterol inhaler or jet nebulizer for the first time, read the written instructions that come with the inhaler or nebulizer. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you how to use it. Practice using the inhaler or nebulizer while he or she watches. If your child will be using the inhaler, be sure that he or she knows how to use it. Watch your child each time he or she uses the inhaler to be sure that he or she is using it correctly. To inhale the aerosol using an inhaler, follow these steps: Remove the protective dust cap from the end of the mouthpiece. If the dust cap was not placed on the mouthpiece, check the mouthpiece for dirt or other objects. Be sure that the canister is fully and firmly inserted in the mouthpiece. If you are using the inhaler for the first time or if you have not used the inhaler in more than 14 days, you will need to prime it. You may also need to prime the inhaler if it has been dropped. Ask your pharmacist or check the manufacturer's information if this happens. To prime the inhaler, shake it well and then press down on the canister 4 times to release 4 sprays into the air, away from your face. Be careful not to get albuterol in your eyes. Shake the inhaler well. Breathe out as completely as possible through your mouth. Hold the canister with the mouthpiece on the bottom, facing you and the canister pointing upward. Place the open end of the mouthpiece into your mouth. Close your lips tightly around the mouthpiece. Breathe in slowly and deeply through the mouthpiece.At the same time, press down once on the container to spray the medication into your mouth. Try to hold your breath for 10 seconds. remove the inhaler, and breathe out slowly. If you were told to use 2 puffs, wait 1 minute and then repeat steps 3-7. Replace the protective cap on the inhaler. Clean your inhaler regularly. Follow the manufacturer's directions carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about cleaning your inhaler. To inhale the powder using the inhaler, follow these steps. Do not use the Respiclick inhaler with a spacer: If you will be using a new inhaler for the first time, remove it from the foil wrapper. Look at the dose counter at the back of the inhaler and check that you see the number 200 in the window. Holding the inhaler upright, with the cap on the bottom and the inhaler pointing upwards, load the dose by opening the protective dust cap at the end of the mouthpiece until it clicks. Do not open the cap unless you are ready to use the inhaler. Every time the protective cap is opened, a dose is ready to inhale. You will see the number in the dose counter go down. Do not waste doses by opening the inhaler unless you are inhaling a dose. Breathe out as completely as possible through your mouth. Do not blow or exhale into the inhaler. Place the mouthpiece between your lips well into your mouth. Close your lips tightly around the mouthpiece. Inhale slowly and deeply through your mouth. Do not breath in through your nose. Make sure that your fingers or lips do not block the vent above the mouthpiece. Remove the inhaler from your mouth and hold your breath for 10 seconds or as long as you comfortably can. Do not blow or exhale through the inhaler. Close the cap firmly over the mouthpiece. If you are to inhale 2 puffs, repeat steps 2-6. Keep the inhaler clean and dry at all times. To clean your inhaler, use a clean, dry tissue or cloth. Do not wash or put any part of your inhaler in water. To inhale the solution using a nebulizer, follow these steps; Remove one vial of albuterol solution from the foil pouch. Leave the rest of the vials in the pouch until you are ready to use them. Look at the liquid in the vial. It should be clear and colorless. Do not use the vial if the liquid is cloudy or discolored. Twist off the top of the vial and squeeze all of the liquid into the nebulizer reservoir. If you are using your nebulizer to inhale other medications, ask your doctor or pharmacist if you can place the other medications in the reservoir along with albuterol. Connect the nebulizer reservoir to the mouthpiece or face mask. Connect the nebulizer to the compressor. Place the mouthpiece in your mouth or put on the face mask. Sit in an upright, comfortable position and turn on the compressor. Breathe in calmly, deeply, and evenly for about 5-15 minutes until mist stops forming in the nebulizer chamber. Clean your nebulizer regularly. Follow the manufacturer's directions carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about cleaning your nebulizer.

Medroxyprogesterone Injection,"IMPORTANT WARNING: Medroxyprogesterone injection may decrease the amount of calcium stored in your bones. The longer you use this medication, the more the amount of calcium in your bones may decrease. The amount of calcium in your bones may not return to normal even after you stop using medroxyprogesterone injection. Loss of calcium from your bones may cause osteoporosis (a condition in which the bones become thin and weak) and may increase the risk that your bones might break at some time in your life, especially after menopause (change of life). The amount of calcium in the bones usually increases during the teenage years. A decrease in bone calcium during this important time of bone strengthening may be especially serious. It is not known whether your risk of developing osteoporosis later in life is greater if you start to use medroxyprogesterone injection when you are a teenager or young adult. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family has osteoporosis; if you have or have ever had any other bone disease or anorexia nervosa (an eating disorder); or if you drink a lot of alcohol or smoke a great deal. Tell your doctor if you take any of the following medications: corticosteroids such as dexamethasone (Decadron, Dexone), methylprednisolone (Medrol), and prednisone (Deltasone); or medications for seizures such as carbamazepine (Tegretol), phenytoin (Dilantin), or phenobarbital (Luminal, Solfoton). You should not use medroxyprogesterone injection for a long time (e.g., more than 2 years) unless no other method of birth control is right for you or no other medication will work to treat your condition. Your doctor may test your bones to be sure they are not becoming too thin before you continue to use medroxyprogesterone injection. Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will monitor your health carefully to be sure you do not develop osteoporosis. Talk to your doctor about the risks of using medroxyprogesterone injection.

Medroxyprogesterone is in a class of medications called progestins. It works to prevent pregnancy by preventing ovulation (the release of eggs from the ovaries). Medroxyprogesterone also thins the lining of the uterus. This helps to prevent pregnancy in all women and slows the spread of tissue from the uterus to other parts of the body in women who have endometriosis. Medroxyprogesterone injection is a very effective method of birth control but does not prevent the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]) or other sexually transmitted diseases. How should this medicine be used? Medroxyprogesterone intramuscular injection comes as a suspension (liquid) to be injected into the buttocks or upper arm. It is usually given once every 3 months (13 weeks) by a healthcare provider in an office or clinic. Medroxyprogesterone subcutaneous injection comes as suspension to be injected just under the skin.

Nonprescription aspirin comes as a regular tablet, a delayed-release (releases the medication in the intestine to prevent damage to the stomach) tablet, a chewable tablet, powder, and a gum to take by mouth. Prescription aspirin is usually taken two or more times a day. Nonprescription aspirin is usually taken once a day to lower the risk of a heart attack or stroke. Nonprescription aspirin is usually taken every 4 to 6 hours as needed to treat fever or pain. Follow the directions on the package or prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take aspirin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than directed by the package label or prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the extended-release tablets whole with a full glass of water. Do not break, crush, or chew them. Swallow the delayed-release tablets with a full glass of water. Chewable aspirin tablets may be chewed, crushed, or swallowed whole. Drink a full glass of water, immediately after taking these tablets. Ask a doctor before you give aspirin to your child or teenager. Aspirin may cause Reye's syndrome (a serious condition in which fat builds up on the brain, liver, and other body organs) in children and teenagers, especially if they have a virus such as chicken pox or the flu. If you have had oral surgery or surgery to remove your tonsils in the last 7 days, talk to your doctor about which types of aspirin are safe for you. Delayed-release tablets begin to work some time after they are taken. Do not take delayed-release tablets for fever or pain that must be relieved quickly. Stop taking aspirin and call your doctor if your fever lasts longer than 3 days, if your pain lasts longer than 10 days, or if the part of your body that was painful becomes red or swollen. You may have a condition that must be treated by a doctor. Other uses for this medicine Aspirin is also sometimes used to treat rheumatic fever (a serious condition that may develop after a strep throat infection and may cause swelling of the heart valves) and Kawasaki disease (an illness that may cause heart problems in children). Aspirin is also sometimes used to lower the risk of blood clots in patients who have artificial heart valves or certain other heart conditions and to prevent certain complications of pregnancy.

Acitretin,"IMPORTANT WARNING: For female patients: Do not take acitretin if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant within the next 3 years. Acitretin may harm the fetus. You should not begin taking acitretin until you have taken two pregnancy tests with negative results. You must use two acceptable forms of birth control for 1 month before you begin taking acitretin, during your treatment with acitretin, and for 3 years after treatment. Your doctor will tell you which methods of birth control are acceptable. You do not need to use two methods of birth control if you have had a hysterectomy (surgery to remove the womb), if your doctor tells you that you have finished menopause (change of life), or if you practice total sexual abstinence. If you plan to use oral contraceptives (birth control pills) while taking acitretin, tell your doctor the name of the pill you will use. Acitretin interferes with the action of microdosed progestin ('minipill') oral contraceptives. Do not use this type of birth control while taking acitretin. If you plan to use hormonal contraceptives (birth control pills, patches, implants, injections, and intrauterine devices), be sure to tell your doctor about all the medications, vitamins, and herbal supplements you are taking. Many medications interfere with the action of hormonal contraceptives. Do not take St. John's wort if you are using any type of hormonal contraceptive. You will need to take pregnancy tests regularly during your treatment with acitretin and for at least 3 years after taking acitretin. Stop taking acitretin and call your doctor immediately if you become pregnant, miss a menstrual period, or have sex without using two forms of birth control. In some cases, your doctor can prescribe emergency contraception ('the morning after pill') to prevent pregnancy. Do not consume foods, drinks, or prescription or nonprescription medications that contain alcohol while taking acitretin and for 2 months after treatment. Alcohol and acitretin combine to form a substance that remains in the blood for a long time and can harm the fetus. Read medication and food labels carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure whether a medication contains alcohol. Your doctor will give you a Patient Agreement/Informed Consent to read and sign before you begin treatment. Be sure to read this carefully and ask your doctor if you have any questions. For male patients: A small amount of acitretin is present in the semen of male patients who take this medication. It is not known whether this small amount of medication can harm the fetus. Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking this medication if your partner is pregnant or plans to become pregnant. For male and female patients: Do not donate blood while taking acitretin and for 3 years after treatment. Acitretin may cause liver damage. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had liver disease. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, pain in the upper right part of the stomach, yellowing of the skin or eyes, or dark urine. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with acitretin and each time you fill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/ucm388814.htm ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide. Why is this medication prescribed? Acitretin is used to treat severe psoriasis (abnormal growth of skin cells that causes red, thickened, or scaly skin). Acitretin is in a class of medications called retinoids. The way acitretin works is not known. How should this medicine be used? Acitretin comes as a capsule to take by mouth.

Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor may start you on a low dose of acitretin and gradually increase your dose. Acitretin controls psoriasis but does not cure it. It may take 2â3 months or longer before you feel the full benefit of acitretin. Your psoriasis may get worse during the first few months of treatment. This does not mean that acitretin will not work for you, but tell your doctor if this happens. Continue to take acitretin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking acitretin without talking to your doctor. After you stop taking acitretin, your symptoms may come back. Tell your doctor if this happens. Do not use leftover acitretin to treat a new flare-up of psoriasis. A different medication or dose may be needed.

Your doctor will probably tell you not to take metformin. Also, tell your doctor if you are over 65 years old and if you have ever had a heart attack; stroke; diabetic ketoacidosis (blood sugar that is high enough to cause severe symptoms and requires emergency medical treatment); a coma; or heart or liver disease. Taking certain other medications with metformin may increase the risk of lactic acidosis. Tell your doctor if you are taking acetazolamide (Diamox), dichlorphenamide (Keveyis), methazolamide, topiramate (Topamax, in Qsymia), or zonisamide (Zonegran). Tell your doctor if you have recently had any of the following conditions, or if you develop them during treatment: serious infection; severe diarrhea, vomiting, or fever; or if you drink much less fluid than usual for any reason. You may have to stop taking metformin until you recover. If you are having surgery, including dental surgery, or any major medical procedure, tell the doctor that you are taking metformin. Also, tell your doctor if you plan to have any x-ray procedure in which dye is injected, especially if you drink or have ever drunk large amounts of alcohol or have or have had liver disease or heart failure. You may need to stop taking metformin before the procedure and wait  at least 48 hours to restart treatment. Your doctor will tell you exactly when you should stop taking metformin and when you should start taking it again. If you experience any of the following symptoms, stop taking metformin and call your doctor immediately: extreme tiredness, weakness, or discomfort; nausea; vomiting; stomach pain; decreased appetite; deep and rapid breathing or shortness of breath; dizziness; lightheadedness; fast or slow heartbeat; muscle pain; or feeling cold, especially in your hands or feet. Tell your doctor if you regularly drink alcohol or sometimes drink large amounts of alcohol in a short time (binge drinking). Drinking alcohol increases your risk of developing lactic acidosis or may cause a decrease in blood sugar. Ask your doctor how much alcohol is safe to drink while you are taking metformin. Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain tests before and during treatment to check how well your kidneys are working and your body's response to metformin. Talk to your doctor about the risk(s) of taking metformin. Why is this medication prescribed? Metformin is used alone or with other medications, including insulin, to treat type 2 diabetes (condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and, therefore, cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood). Metformin is in a class of drugs called biguanides. Metformin helps to control the amount of glucose (sugar) in your blood. It decreases the amount of glucose you absorb from your food and the amount of glucose made by your liver. Metformin also increases your body's response to insulin, a natural substance that controls the amount of glucose in the blood. Metformin is not used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood). Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Taking medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease. Your doctor and other healthcare providers will talk to you about the best way to manage your diabetes. How should this medicine be used? Metformin comes as a tablet, an extended-release (long-acting) tablet, and a solution (liquid) to take by mouth. The solution is usually taken with meals one or two times a day. The regular tablet is usually taken with meals two or three times a day. The extended-release tablet is usually taken once daily with the evening meal. To help you remember to take metformin, take it around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take metformin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow metformin extended-release tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. Your doctor may start you on a low dose of metformin and gradually increase your dose not more often than once every 1â2 weeks. You will need to monitor your blood sugar carefully so your doctor will be able to tell how well metformin is working. Metformin controls diabetes but does not cure it. Continue to take metformin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking metformin without talking to your doctor.

Acyclovir,"Why is this medication prescribed? Acyclovir is used to decrease pain and speed the healing of sores or blisters in people who have varicella (chickenpox), herpes zoster (shingles; a rash that can occur in people who have had chickenpox in the past), and first-time or repeat outbreaks of genital herpes (a herpes virus infection that causes sores to form around the genitals and rectum from time to time). Acyclovir is also sometimes used to prevent outbreaks of genital herpes in people who are infected with the virus. Acyclovir is in a class of antiviral medications called synthetic nucleoside analogues. It works by stopping the spread of the herpes virus in the body. Acyclovir will not cure genital herpes and may not stop the spread of genital herpes to other people. How should this medicine be used? Acyclovir comes as a tablet, a capsule, and a suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It also comes as a delayed-release buccal tablet to apply to the upper gum of the mouth. The tablets, capsules, and suspension are usually taken with or without food two to five times a day for 5 to 10 days, starting as soon as possible after your symptoms begin. When acyclovir is used to prevent outbreaks of genital herpes, it is usually taken two to five times a day for up to 12 months.  The delayed-release buccal tablet is usually applied with a dry finger as a one-time dose within 1 hour after itching, redness, burning or tingling cold sore symptoms begin but before the cold sore appears. Take or use acyclovir at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take or use acyclovir exactly as directed. Do not take or use more or less of it or take it more often or for a longer time than prescribed by your doctor. Do not chew, crush, suck, or swallow the delayed-release buccal tablets. Drink plenty of liquids, if you have a dry mouth while using the delayed-release buccal tablets. To use buccal acyclovir, follow these steps: Find the area on the upper gum above your left and right incisor teeth (the teeth just to the left and right of your two front teeth). With dry hands, remove one delayed-release tablet from the container. Gently apply the tablet to the upper gum area as high as it will go on your gum above one of your incisor teeth on the side of your mouth with the cold sore. Do not apply it to the inside of the lip or cheek. Hold the tablet in place for 30 seconds. If the tablet does not stick to your gum or if it sticks to your cheek or the inside of your lip, reposition it to stick to your gum. Leave the tablet in place until it dissolves. Do not interfere with the placement of the tablet. Check to see if the tablet is still in place after eating, drinking, or rinsing your mouth. If the delayed-release buccal tablet comes off within the first 6 hours of application, reapply the same tablet. If it still will not stick, then apply a new tablet. If you accidentally swallow the tablet within the first 6 hours of application, drink a glass of water and place a new tablet on your gum. If the tablet falls off or is swallowed 6 or more hours after application, do not apply a new tablet until your next regular time. Avoid the following while you are using acyclovir buccal delayed-release tablet: Do not chew gum, touch, or press the buccal tablet after it has been applied. Do not wear upper dentures. Do not brush your teeth until it dissolves. If your teeth need to be cleaned while the tablet is in place, rinse the mouth gently. Shake the suspension well before each use to mix the medication evenly. Your symptoms should improve during your treatment with acyclovir. Call your doctor if your symptoms do not improve or if they get worse. Take or use acyclovir until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop taking acyclovir too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated or may become more difficult to treat. The delayed-release buccal tablet is applied as a one-time dose. Other uses for this medicine Acyclovir is also sometimes used to treat eczema herpeticum (a skin infection caused by the herpes virus) to treat and prevent herpes infections of the skin, eyes, nose, and mouth in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and to treat oral hairy leukoplakia (condition that causes hairy white or gray-colored patches on the tongue or inside of the cheek).

"Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis (Tdap) Vaccine","Why get vaccinated? Tdap vaccine can prevent tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. Diphtheria and pertussis spread from person to person. Tetanus enters the body through cuts or wounds. TETANUS (T) causes painful stiffening of the muscles. Tetanus can lead to serious health problems, including being unable to open the mouth, having trouble swallowing and breathing, or death. DIPHTHERIA (D) can lead to difficulty breathing, heart failure, paralysis, or death. PERTUSSIS (aP) , also known as ""whooping cough,"" can cause uncontrollable, violent coughing that makes it hard to breathe, eat, or drink. Pertussis can be extremely serious especially in babies and young children, causing pneumonia, convulsions, brain damage, or death. In teens and adults, it can cause weight loss, loss of bladder control, passing out, and rib fractures from severe coughing. What is Tdap vaccine? Tdap is only for children 7 years and older, adolescents, and adults. Adolescents should receive a single dose of Tdap, preferably at age 11 or 12 years. Pregnant women should get a dose of Tdap during every pregnancy, preferably during the early part of the third trimester, to help protect the newborn from pertussis. Infants are most at risk for severe, life-threatening complications from pertussis. Adults who have never received Tdap should get a dose of Tdap. Also, adults should receive a booster dose of either Tdap or Td (a different vaccine that protects against tetanus and diphtheria but not pertussis) every 10 years, or after 5 years in the case of a severe or dirty wound or burn. Tdap may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Talk with your healthcare provider Tell your vaccination provider if the person getting the vaccine: Has had an allergic reaction after a previous dose of any vaccine that protects against tetanus, diphtheria, or pertussis, or has any severe, life-threatening allergies Has had a coma, decreased level of consciousness, or prolonged seizures within 7 days after a previous dose of any pertussis vaccine (DTP, DTaP, or Tdap) Has seizures or another nervous system problem Has ever had Guillain-BarrÃ© Syndrome (also called ""GBS"") Has had severe pain or swelling after a previous dose of any vaccine that protects against tetanus or diphtheria In some cases, your health care provider may decide to postpone Tdap vaccination until a future visit. People with minor illnesses, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. People who are moderately or severely ill should usually wait until they recover before getting Tdap vaccine. Your health care provider can give you more information. What are the risks of a vaccine reaction? Pain, redness, or swelling where the shot was given, mild fever, headache, feeling tired, and nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or stomachache sometimes happen after Tdap vaccination. People sometimes faint after medical procedures, including vaccination. Tell your provider if you feel dizzy or have vision changes or ringing in the ears. As with any medicine, there is a very remote chance of a vaccine causing a severe allergic reaction, other serious injury, or death. What if there is a serious reaction? An allergic reaction could occur after the vaccinated person leaves the clinic. If you see signs of a severe allergic reaction (hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, or weakness), call 9-1-1 and get the person to the nearest hospital. For other signs that concern you, call your health care provider. Adverse reactions should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your health care provider will usually file this report, or you can do it yourself. Visit the VAERS website at https://www.vaers.hhs.gov or call 1-800-822-7967 . VAERS is only for reporting reactions, and VAERS staff members do not give medical advice.

Nifedipine,"Why is this medication prescribed? Nifedipine is used to treat high blood pressure and to control angina (chest pain). Nifedipine is in a class of medications called calcium-channel blockers. It lowers blood pressure by relaxing the blood vessels so the heart does not have to pump as hard. It controls chest pain by increasing the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart. High blood pressure is a common condition and when not treated, can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.

It works by stopping pimples from forming under the surface of the skin. How should this medicine be used?

Your acne may get worse during the first few weeks of treatment, and it may take 8 to 12 weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of adapalene. During the first weeks of your treatment, adapalene may bring previously unseen pimples to the skin surface. Continue to use adapalene even if your acne worsens or you do not see much improvement at first. Do not apply adapalene to skin that is sunburned, broken, or covered with eczema (a skin disease).

Tadalafil,"Why is this medication prescribed? Tadalafil (Cialis) is used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED, impotence; inability to get or keep an erection), and the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH; an enlarged prostate) which include difficulty urinating (hesitation, dribbling, weak stream, and incomplete bladder emptying), painful urination, and urinary frequency and urgency in adult men. Tadalafil (Adcirca) is used to improve the ability to exercise in people with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH; high blood pressure in the vessels carrying blood to the lungs, causing shortness of breath, dizziness, and tiredness). Tadalafil is in a class of medications called phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors. It works to treat erectile dysfunction by increasing blood flow to the penis during sexual stimulation. This increased blood flow can cause an erection. Tadalafil treats PAH by relaxing the blood vessels in the lungs to allow blood to flow more easily. If you are taking tadalafil to treat erectile dysfunction, you should know that it does not cure erectile dysfunction or increase sexual desire. Tadalafil does not prevent pregnancy or the spread of sexually transmitted diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). How should this medicine be used? Tadalafil comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It may be taken with or without food. If you are taking tadalafil to treat erectile dysfunction, follow your doctor's directions and the guidelines in this paragraph. There are two different ways to take tadalafil, either daily or on an as needed basis. Talk to your doctor about which dosing schedule is right for you. Tadalafil is sometimes taken as needed, usually at least 30 minutes before sexual activity and not more often than once every 24 hours. Your doctor will help you decide the best time for you to take tadalafil before sexual activity. Tadalafil is also sometimes taken once a day every day without regard to timing of sexual activity. You may attempt sexual activity at any time between doses. If you are taking tadalafil on a regular schedule, take it at around the same time every day. If you have certain health conditions or are taking certain medications, your doctor may tell you to take tadalafil less often or may prescribe a lower dose to be taken once a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take tadalafil exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. If you are taking tadalafil to treat PAH or BPH, follow your doctor's directions and the guidelines in this paragraph. You should take tadalafil one time a day. Take all of the tablets for your daily dose at one time each day; do not divide the tablets to take as separate doses. Take tadalafil at around the same time every day. If you are already taking medication to treat BPH, your doctor may tell you to stop taking your other medication at least one day before starting treatment with tadalafil. Follow your doctor's directions carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. If you are taking tadalafil for erectile dysfunction, your doctor will probably start you on an average dose of tadalafil and increase or decrease your dose depending on your response to the medication. Tell your doctor if tadalafil is not working well or if you are experiencing side effects. If you are taking tadalafil for PAH, you should know that tadalafil controls PAH but does not cure it. Continue to take tadalafil even if you feel well. Do not stop taking tadalafil without talking to your doctor.

Lixisenatide Injection,"Why is this medication prescribed? Lixisenatide injection is used along with diet and exercise to treat type 2 diabetes (condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and  cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood).  Lixisenatide injection is in a class of medications called incretin mimetics. It works by helping the pancreas to release the right amount of  insulin when blood sugar levels are high. Insulin helps move sugar from the blood into other body tissues where it is used for energy. Lixisenatide injection also slows the emptying of the stomach and causes a decrease in appetite. Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Using medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease.

Insulin Lispro Injection,"Notice: Insulin lispro and insulin lispro-aabc are biologic medications (medications made from living organisms). Biosimilar insulin lispro-aabc injection is highly similar to insulin lispro and works the same way as insulin lispro in the body. Therefore, the term insulin lispro products will be used to represent these medications in this discussion. Why is this medication prescribed? Insulin lispro injection products are used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood). Insulin lispro injection products are also used to treat people with type 2 diabetes (condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) who need insulin to control their diabetes. In patients with type 1 diabetes, insulin lispro injection products are always used with another type of insulin, unless it is used in an external insulin pump. In patients with type 2 diabetes, insulin lispro injection products may be used with another type of insulin or with oral medication(s) for diabetes. Insulin lispro injection products are a short-acting, manmade version of human insulin. Insulin lispro injection products work by replacing the insulin that is normally produced by the body and by helping move sugar from the blood into other body tissues where it is used for energy. They also stops the liver from producing more sugar. Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Using medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease.Your doctor and other healthcare providers will talk to you about the best way to manage your diabetes. How should this medicine be used? Insulin lispro injection products come as a solution (liquid) and a suspension (liquid with particles that will settle on standing) to inject subcutaneously (under the skin). Insulin lispro solution (Admelog, Humalog) is usually injected within 15 minutes before a meal or immediately after a meal. Insulin lispro suspension (Humalog Mix 75/25 or Humalog Mix 50/50) should be injected 15 minutes before a meal. Insulin lispro-aabc solution (Lyumjev) should be injected at the beginning of a meal or within 20 minutes after you start eating a meal.Your doctor will tell you how many times you should inject insulin lispro products each day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use insulin lispro injection products exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Insulin lispro injection products may also be injected intravenously (into a vein) by a doctor or nurse in a healthcare setting. A doctor or nurse will carefully monitor you for side effects. Never use insulin lispro injection products when you have symptoms of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) or if you have checked your blood sugar and found it to be low. Insulin lispro injection products control diabetes but do not cure it. Continue to use insulin lispro products even if you feel well. Do not stop using insulin lispro injection products without talking to your doctor. Do not switch to another brand or type of insulin or change the dose of any type of insulin you are using without talking to your doctor. Always check the insulin label to make sure you received the right type of insulin from the pharmacy. Insulin lispro injection products come in vials, cartridges that contain medication and are to be placed in dosing pens, and dosing pens that contain cartridges of medication. Be sure you know what type of container your insulin lispro comes in and what other supplies, such as needles, syringes, or pens you will need to inject your medication. If your insulin lispro injection product comes in vials, you will need to use syringes to inject your dose. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how to inject an insulin lispro injection product using a syringe. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about the type of syringe you should use. If your insulin lispro injection product comes in cartridges, you will need to purchase an insulin pen separately. Check the manufacturer's information for the patient to see what type of pen is right for the cartridge size you are using. Carefully read the instructions that come with your pen, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how to use it. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about the type of pen you should use. If your insulin lispro injection product comes in pens, be sure to read and understand the manufacturer's instructions. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how to use the pen. Follow the directions carefully, and always prime the pen before use. Never reuse needles or syringes and never share needles, syringes, cartridges, or pens. If you are using an insulin pen, always remove the needle right after you inject your dose. Dispose of needles and syringes in a puncture-resistant container. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how to dispose of the puncture-resistant container. Your doctor may tell you to mix your insulin lispro solution with another type of insulin (NPH insulin) in the same syringe. Your doctor will tell you exactly how to do this. Always draw insulin lispro into the syringe first, always use the same brand of syringe, and always inject the insulin immediately after mixing. Insulin lispro injection products should not be mixed with insulin preparations other than NPH insulin. Insulin lispro suspension should not be mixed with any other insulin preparations. Your doctor may tell you to dilute insulin lispro injection products before injection to allow easier measurement of your dose. Your doctor will tell you exactly how to do this. You can inject your insulin lispro injection product in your thighs, stomach, upper arms, or buttocks. Change (rotate) the injection site within the chosen area with each dose. Do not inject where the skin is thick, lumpy, tender, bruised, scaly, hard, or into areas of skin where there are scars or skin is damaged. Always look at your insulin lispro product before you inject it. If you are using insulin lispro solution, the insulin should be clear and colorless. Do not use this type of insulin lispro product if it is colored, cloudy, or contains solid particles. If you are using insulin lispro suspension, the insulin should appear cloudy or milky after you mix it. Do not use this type of insulin product if there are clumps in the liquid or if there are solid white particles sticking to the bottom or walls of the bottle. Do not use any type of insulin after the expiration date printed on the bottle has passed. Insulin lispro suspension must be gently shaken or rolled between your hands to mix before use. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if the type of insulin you are using should be mixed and how you should mix it if necessary. Insulin lispro solution (Admelog, Humalog U-100, Lyumjev U-100) also can be used with an external insulin pump. Before using insulin lispro products in a pump system, read the pump label to make sure the pump can be used for continuous delivery of fast-acting insulin. Read the pump manual for recommended reservoir and tubing sets, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how to use the insulin pump. Do not dilute insulin lispro or mix it with any other type of insulin when using it with an external insulin pump. When using insulin lispro products with an external insulin pump, replace the insulin in the reservoir at least every 7 days (Admelog, Humalog U-100,) or at least every 9 days (Lyumjev U-100), and change the infusion set and infusion set insertion site at least every 3 days. If the infusion site is red, itchy, lumpy, or thickened, tell your doctor and use a different infusion site. When using insulin lispro solution in an external insulin pump, high blood sugar may occur quickly if the pump stops working properly or if the insulin in the pump reservoir is exposed to direct sunlight or temperatures greater than 98.6Â°F (37Â°C). High blood sugar may also occur if the tubing leaks or becomes blocked, disconnected, or kinks. If the problem cannot be found quickly and corrected, call your doctor right away. You may need to temporarily use insulin by subcutaneous injection (using syringes or an insulin pen). Make sure you have back-up insulin and any necessary supplies on hand, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how to use them.

Epinephrine Injection,"Why is this medication prescribed? Epinephrine injection is used along with emergency medical treatment to treat life-threatening allergic reactions caused by insect bites or stings, foods, medications, latex, and other causes. Epinephrine injection is also used to treat life-threatening low blood pressure associated with septic shock (a serious condition caused by a body-wide infection that can lead to dangerously low blood pressure and organ failure) in hospitalized adults. Epinephrine is in a class of medications called alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists (sympathomimetic agents). It works by relaxing the muscles in the airways and tightening the blood vessels. How should this medicine be used? Epinephrine injection comes as a prefilled automatic injection device containing a solution (liquid) and in vials to inject subcutaneously (under the skin) or intramuscularly (into the muscle) to treat life-threatening allergic reactions. It is usually injected as needed at the first sign of a serious allergic reaction. If epinephrine injection is used to treat life-threatening low blood pressure associated with septic shock, it is usually injected intravenously (into a vein) by a doctor or nurse in a medical facility. Use epinephrine injection exactly as directed; do not inject it more often or inject more or less of it than prescribed by your doctor. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you and any of your caregivers who could be injecting the medication how to use the prefilled automatic injection device. Training devices are available to practice how to use the automatic injection device during an emergency. Training devices do not contain medication and do not have a needle. Before you use epinephrine injection for the first time, read the patient information that comes with it. This information includes directions for how to use the prefilled automatic injection device. Be sure to ask your pharmacist or doctor if you or your caregivers have any questions about how to inject this medication. You should inject epinephrine injection as soon as you suspect that you may be experiencing a serious allergic reaction. Signs of a serious allergic reaction include closing of the airways; wheezing; sneezing; hoarseness; rash; hives; itching; swelling of the face, eyes, mouth, throat, hands; skin redness; fast heartbeat; weak pulse; anxiety; confusion; stomach pain; vomiting; diarrhea; losing control of urine or bowel movements; faintness; seizures; or loss of consciousness. Talk to your doctor about these symptoms and be sure you understand how to tell when you are having a serious allergic reaction and should inject epinephrine. You should always keep 2 automatic injection devices with you or available at all times because one dose of epinephrine may not be enough to treat a serious allergic reaction. Keep your automatic injection devices with you or available at all times so that you will be able to inject epinephrine quickly when an allergic reaction begins. Be aware of the expiration date stamped on the device and replace the devices when this date passes. Look at the solution in the devices from time to time. If the solution is discolored or contains particles, call your doctor to get a new injection device. Most automatic injection devices contain enough solution for one dose of epinephrine. If your symptoms continue or return after the first injection, your doctor may tell you to use a second dose of epinephrine injection with a new injection device. Be sure that you know how to inject the second dose and how to tell whether you should inject a second dose. Only a healthcare provider should give more than 2 injections for a single allergic episode. Epinephrine injection helps to treat serious allergic reactions but does not take the place of medical treatment. Get emergency medical treatment immediately after you inject epinephrine. Rest quietly while you wait for emergency medical treatment. Epinephrine should be injected only in the middle of the outer side of the thigh, and can be injected through clothing if necessary in an emergency. If you are injecting epinephrine to a young child who may move during the injection, hold their leg firmly in place and limit the child's movement before and during the injection. Do not inject epinephrine into the buttocks or any other part of your body such as fingers, hands, or feet or into a vein. Do not put your thumb, fingers, or hand over the needle area of the automatic injection device. If epinephrine is accidently injected into these areas, get emergency medical treatment immediately. After you inject a dose of epinephrine injection, some solution will remain in the injection device. This is normal and does not mean that you did not receive the full dose. Do not use the extra liquid; dispose of the remaining liquid and device properly. Take the used device with you to the emergency room or ask your doctor, pharmacist, or healthcare provider how to dispose of used injection devices safely. This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information. What special precautions should I follow? Before using epinephrine injection, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to epinephrine, any other medications, sulfites, or any of the other ingredients in epinephrine injection.

Guaifenesin,"Why is this medication prescribed? Guaifenesin is used to relieve chest congestion. Guaifenesin may help control symptoms but does not treat the cause of symptoms or speed recovery. Guaifenesin is in a class of medications called expectorants. It works by thinning the mucus in the air passages to make it easier to cough up the mucus and clear the airways. How should this medicine be used? Guaifenesin comes as a tablet, a capsule, an extended-release (long-acting) tablet, dissolving granules, and a syrup (liquid) to take by mouth. The tablets, capsules, dissolving granules, and syrup are usually taken with or without food every 4 hours as needed. The extended-release tablet is usually taken with or without food every 12 hours. Follow the directions on the package or on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take guaifenesin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Guaifenesin comes alone and in combination with antihistamines, cough suppressants, and decongestants. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice on which product is best for your symptoms. Check nonprescription cough and cold product labels carefully before using two or more products at the same time. These products may contain the same active ingredient(s) and taking them together could cause you to receive an overdose. This is especially important if you will be giving cough and cold medications to a child. Nonprescription cough and cold combination products, including products that contain guaifenesin, can cause serious side effects or death in young children. Do not give these products to children younger than 4 years of age. If you give these products to children 4 to 11 years of age, use caution and follow the package directions carefully. If you are giving guaifenesin or a combination product that contains guaifenesin to a child, read the package label carefully to be sure that it is the right product for a child of that age. Do not give guaifenesin products that are made for adults to children. Before you give a guaifenesin product to a child, check the package label to find out how much medication the child should receive. Give the dose that matches the child's age on the chart. Ask the child's doctor if you don't know how much medication to give the child. If you are taking the liquid, do not use a household spoon to measure your dose. Use the measuring spoon or cup that came with the medication or use a spoon made especially for measuring medication. Swallow the extended-release tablets whole with a full glass of water. Do not break, crush, or chew them. If you are taking the dissolving granules, empty the entire contents of the packet onto your tongue and swallow. If your symptoms do not improve within 7 days or if you also have a high fever, a rash, or a headache that does not go away, call your doctor. Other uses for this medicine This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information. What special precautions should I follow?

If you become pregnant while taking guaifenesin, call your doctor. if you have phenylketonuria (PKU, a inherited condition in which a special diet must be followed to prevent damage to your brain that can cause severe intellectual disability), you should know that the dissolving granules may be sweetened with aspartame, a source of phenylalanine. What special dietary instructions should I follow? Drink plenty of fluids while you are taking this medication. Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet. What should I do if I forget a dose? Guaifenesin is usually taken as needed. If your doctor has told you to take guaifenesin regularly, take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.

Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away: headache nausea vomiting Guaifenesin may cause other side effects.

The combination of fluticasone and salmeterol (Advair Â® Diskus, Advair Â® HFA, AirDuo Â® Respiclick) is used to treat difficulty breathing, wheezing, shortness of breath, coughing, and chest tightness caused by asthma. The combination of fluticasone and salmeterol (Advair Â® Diskus) is also used to prevent and treat wheezing, shortness of breath, coughing, and chest tightness caused by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; a group of lung diseases that includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema).

It works by reducing swelling in the airways. Salmeterol is in a class of medications called long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs). It works by relaxing and opening air passages in the lungs, making it easier to breathe. How should this medicine be used? The combination of fluticasone and salmeterol comes as a powder and as an inhalation solution to inhale by mouth using a specially designed inhaler. It is usually used twice a day, in the morning and evening, about 12 hours apart. Use fluticasone and salmeterol at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use fluticasone and salmeterol exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Talk to your doctor about how you should take your other oral or inhaled medications for asthma during your treatment with salmeterol and fluticasone inhalation. If you were using a short-acting beta agonist inhaler such as albuterol (Proventil Â® , Ventolin Â® ) on a regular basis, your doctor will probably tell you to stop using it regularly but to continue to use it to treat sudden attacks of asthma symptoms.

Flunisolide Oral Inhalation,"Why is this medication prescribed? Flunisolide oral inhalation is used to prevent difficulty breathing, chest tightness, wheezing, and coughing caused by asthma in adults and children 6 years of age and older. It is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. Flunisolide works by decreasing swelling and irritation in the airways to allow for easier breathing. How should this medicine be used? Flunisolide comes as an aerosol to inhale by mouth. It usually is inhaled twice daily. Try to use flunisolide at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use flunisolide exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Talk to your doctor about how you should use your other oral and inhaled medications for asthma during your treatment with flunisolide inhalation. If you are using any other inhaled medications, ask your doctor if you should inhale these medications a certain amount of time before and after you inhale flunisolide inhalation. If you were taking an oral steroid such as dexamethasone, methylprednisolone (Medrol), or prednisone (Rayos), your doctor may want to gradually decrease your steroid dose starting at least one week after you begin to use flunisolide inhalation. Flunisolide inhalation helps to prevent asthma attacks (sudden episodes of shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing) but will not stop an asthma attack that has already started. Do not use flunisolide inhalation during an asthma attack. Your doctor will prescribe a short-acting inhaler to use during asthma attacks. Your doctor will probably start you on an average dose of flunisolide inhalation. Your doctor may increase it if your symptoms have not improved after at least 4 weeks and later may decrease your dose when your symptoms are controlled. Flunisolide inhalation controls asthma but does not cure it. It may take 2 to 4 weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of the medication. Continue to use flunisolide inhalation even if you feel well. Do not stop using flunisolide inhalation without talking to your doctor. Tell your doctor if your asthma worsens during your treatment. Call your doctor if you have an asthma attack that does not stop when you use your fast-acting asthma medication, or if you need to use more of your fast-acting medication than usual. Each canister of flunisolide aerosol is designed to provide 60 or 120 inhalations, depending on its size. After the labeled number of inhalations has been used, later inhalations may not contain the correct amount of medication. You should also keep track of the number of inhalations you use each day to know the exact amount of sprays that remain in your inhaler. Throw away the canister after you have used the labeled number of inhalations even if it still contains some liquid and continues to release a spray when it is pressed. If your inhaler is dropped, do not use the number on the counter to predict the number of sprays left in your inhaler. Before you use your flunisolide aerosol inhaler the first time, read the written instructions that come with it. Look at the diagrams carefully and be sure that you recognize all the parts of the inhaler. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you how to use it. Do not use your flunisolide inhaler while you are near an open flame or a heat source. The inhaler may explode if it is exposed to very high temperatures. To use the aerosol inhaler, follow these steps. Do not use the inhaler with any additional spacers.: Be sure that the inhaler is at room temperature. If you are using the inhaler for the first time or if you have not used the inhaler in more than 14 days, prime it by releasing 2 test sprays into the air, away from your face. Be careful not to spray the medication into your eyes or face. Place the bottom of the gray spacer on the base of your thumb and your index finger on the canister. Check to make sure that the canister is placed into the purple actuator. Hold the canister between your thumb and index finger and shake the inhaler. Breathe in and out through your mouth. After breathing out, place the mouthpiece in your mouth and close your lips around it. Breathe in deeply and slowly through your mouth. At the same time, press down firmly on the center of the dose indicator at the top of the canister with your index finger. Remove your index finger as soon as the spray is released. When you have breathed in fully for at least 3 seconds, remove the inhaler from your mouth and close your mouth. Try to hold your breath for about 10 seconds, then breathe out gently and then breathe normally. If your doctor has told you to take more than one puffs per treatment, repeat steps 4 through 9. Press the actuator back into the straight position. Rinse your mouth with water and spit the water out. Do not swallow the water.

Everolimus (Afinitor) is also used to treat a certain type of cancer of the pancreas, stomach, intestines, or lungs that has spread or progressed and that cannot be treated with surgery. Everolimus (Afinitor) is also used to treat kidney tumors in people with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC; a genetic condition that causes tumors to grow in many organs). Everolimus (Afinitor and Afinitor Disperz) is also used to treat subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA; a type of brain tumor) in adults and children 1 year of age and older who have TSC. Everolimus (Afinitor Disperz) is also used along with other medications to treat certain types of seizures in adults and children 2 years of age and older who have TSC. Everolimus (Zortress) is used with other medications to prevent transplant rejection (attack of the transplanted organ by the immune system of the person who received the organ) in certain adults who have received kidney transplants. Everolimus is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. Everolimus treats cancer by stopping cancer cells from reproducing and by decreasing blood supply to the cancer cells. Everolimus prevents transplant rejection by decreasing the activity of the immune system. How should this medicine be used? Everolimus comes as a tablet to take by mouth and as a tablet to suspend in water and take by mouth. When everolimus is taken to treat kidney tumors, SEGA, or seizures in people who have TSC; RCC; or breast, pancreatic, stomach, intestine, or lung cancer, it is usually taken once a day. When everolimus is taken to prevent transplant rejection, it is usually taken twice a day (every 12 hours) at the same time as cyclosporine.

To prepare the mixture in an oral syringe, remove the plunger from a 10-mL oral syringe and place the prescribed number of tablets in the barrel of the syringe without breaking or crushing the tablets. You can prepare up to 10 mg of everolimus in a syringe at one time, so if your dose is greater than 10 mg, you will need to prepare it in a second syringe. Replace the plunger in the syringe and draw about 5 mL of water and 4 mL of air into the syringe and place the syringe into a container with the tip pointing up. Wait 3 minutes to allow the tablets to go into suspension. then pick up the syringe and gently turn it up and down it five times. Place the syringe into the patient's mouth and push the plunger to administer the medication. After the patient has swallowed the medication, refill the same syringe with 5 mL of water and 4 mL of air and swirl the syringe to rinse out any particles that are still in the syringe. Give this mixture to the patient to be sure that he or she receives all of the medication. To prepare the mixture in a glass, place the prescribed number of tablets into a small drinking glass that holds no more than 100 mL (about 3 ounces) without crushing or breaking the tablets. You can prepare up to 10 mg of everolimus in a glass at one time, so if your dose is greater than 10 mg, you will need to prepare it in a second glass. Add 25 mL (about 1 ounce) of water to the glass. Wait 3 minutes and then gently stir the mixture with a spoon. Have the patient drink the entire mixture immediately. Add another 25 mL of water to the glass and stir with the same spoon to rinse out any particles that are still in the glass. Have the patient drink this mixture to be sure that he or she receives all of the medication.

Influenza vaccine, inactivated or recombinant may prevent influenza illness (flu) that may occur with infection due to the influenza virus.

Flu can cause fever and chills, sore throat, muscle aches, fatigue, cough, headache, and runny or stuffy nose. Flu can cause other complications such as sinus infections and pneumonia and can lead to hospitalization and death. Influenza vaccine, inactivated or recombinant does not contain the influenza virus.

Influenza Vaccine, Inactivated or Recombinant comes as a suspension (liquid) to be given intramuscularly (into the muscle) by a healthcare provider. Influenza Vaccine, Inactivated or Recombinant is given as a single dose each season. Some individuals may have a second dose recommended based on age and prior history of vaccine.

Insulin Human Inhalation,"IMPORTANT WARNING: Insulin inhalation may decrease lung function and can cause bronchospasms (breathing difficulties). Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; a group of diseases that affect the lungs and airways). Your doctor will tell you not to use insulin inhalation if you have asthma or COPD. Your doctor will order certain tests to check how well your lungs are working before therapy, 6 months after starting therapy, and annually while using insulin inhalation treatment. Tell your doctor if you have any of the following symptoms: wheezing or difficulty breathing. Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with insulin inhalation and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide. Talk to your doctor about the risks of using insulin inhalation. Why is this medication prescribed? Insulin inhalation is used in combination with a long-acting insulin to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood). It is also used in combination with other medications to treat people with type 2 diabetes (condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and, therefore, cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) who need insulin to control their diabetes. Insulin inhalation is not used for the treatment diabetic ketoacidosis (a serious condition that may develop if high blood sugar is not treated). Insulin inhalation is a short-acting, man-made version of human insulin. Insulin inhalation works by replacing the insulin that is normally produced by the body and by helping to move sugar from the blood into other body tissues where it is used for energy. It also stops the liver from producing more sugar. Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Using medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease. Your doctor and other healthcare providers will talk to you about the best way to manage your diabetes. How should this medicine be used? Insulin inhalation comes as a powder to inhale by mouth using a special inhaler. It is usually used at the beginning of each meal.

Follow your doctor's instructions about how many insulin inhalation cartridges you should use each day.

Albiglutide Injection,"Notice: Albiglutide has been discontinued in the US. Because this drug is no longer available in the US market, the material in this monograph is no longer updated. If this drug is used in countries other than the U.S., it is essential that the manufacturersâ labeling be consulted for more recently available information. IMPORTANT WARNING: Albiglutide injection may increase the risk that you will develop tumors of the thyroid gland, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC; a type of thyroid cancer). Laboratory animals who were given medications similar to albiglutide developed tumors, but it is not known if these medications increase the risk of tumors in humans. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had MTC or Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2; condition that causes tumors in more than one gland in the body). If so, your doctor will probably tell you not to use albiglutide injection. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: a lump or swelling in the neck; hoarseness; difficulty swallowing; or shortness of breath. Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor may order certain tests to check your body's response to albiglutide injection. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with albiglutide injection and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide. Talk to your doctor about the risks of using albiglutide injection. Why is this medication prescribed? Albiglutide injection is used with a diet and exercise program to control blood sugar levels in adults with type 2 diabetes (condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) when other medications did not control levels well enough. Albiglutide injection is not used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) or diabetic ketoacidosis (a serious condition that may develop if high blood sugar is not treated). Albiglutide injection is in a class of medications called incretin mimetics. It works by helping the pancreas to release the right amount of insulin when blood sugar levels are high. Insulin helps move sugar from the blood into other body tissues where it is used for energy. Albiglutide injection also works by slowing the movement of food through the stomach. Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Using medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease. Your doctor and other healthcare providers will talk to you about the best way to manage your diabetes. How should this medicine be used? Albiglutide injection comes as a powder to be mixed with water in a prefilled dosing pen to inject subcutaneously (under the skin). It is usually injected once a week without regard to meals. Use albiglutide injection on the same day each week at any time of day. You may change the day of the week that you use albiglutide as long as it has been 4 or more days since you used your last dose. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use albiglutide injection exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Albiglutide injection controls diabetes but does not cure it. Continue to use albiglutide injection even if you feel well. Do not stop using albiglutide injection without talking to your doctor. Albiglutide comes in prefilled dosing pens that contain enough medication for one dose. Always inject albiglutide in its own prefilled dosing pen; never mix it with any other medication. Carefully read the manufacturer's instructions for use that come with the medication. These instructions describe how to prepare and inject a dose of albiglutide injection. Be sure to ask your pharmacist or doctor if you have any questions about how to prepare or inject this medication. Always look at your albiglutide before you inject it. It should be clear, yellow, and free of solid particles. You can inject your albiglutide in your upper arm, thigh, or stomach area. Never inject albiglutide into a vein or muscle. Change (rotate) the injection site within the chosen area with each dose. You can inject albiglutide and insulin in the same body area, but you should not give the injections right next to each other. Never reuse or share needles or pens. Always use a new needle for each injection. Dispose of needles in a puncture-resistant container. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how to dispose of the puncture resistant container.

If you become pregnant while using albiglutide injection, call your doctor. ask your doctor what to do if you get sick, develop an infection or fever, or experience unusual stress.

Albuterol and Ipratropium Oral Inhalation,"Why is this medication prescribed? The combination of albuterol and ipratropium is used to prevent wheezing, difficulty breathing, chest tightness, and coughing in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; a group of diseases that affect the lungs and airways) such as chronic bronchitis (swelling of the air passages that lead to the lungs) and emphysema (damage to the air sacs in the lungs). Albuterol and ipratropium combination is used by people whose symptoms have not been controlled by a single inhaled medication. Albuterol and ipratropium are in a class of medications called bronchodilators. Albuterol and ipratropium combination works by relaxing and opening the air passages to the lungs to make breathing easier. How should this medicine be used? The combination of albuterol and ipratropium comes as a solution (liquid) to inhale by mouth using a nebulizer (machine that turns medication into a mist that can be inhaled) and as a spray to inhale by mouth using an inhaler. It is usually inhaled four times a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use albuterol and ipratropium exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor may tell you to use additional doses of albuterol and ipratropium inhalation if you experience symptoms such as wheezing, difficulty breathing, or chest tightness. Follow these directions carefully, and do not use extra doses of medication unless your doctor tells you that you should. Do not use more than 2 extra doses of the nebulizer solution per day. Do not use the inhalation spray more than six times in 24 hours. Call your doctor if your symptoms worsen, if you feel that albuterol and ipratropium inhalation no longer controls your symptoms, or if you find that you need to use extra doses of the medication more often. If you are using the inhaler, your medication will come in cartridges. Each cartridge of albuterol and ipratropium inhalation spray is designed to provide 120 inhalations. This is enough medication to last one month if you use one inhalation four times a day. After you use all 120 doses, the inhaler will lock and will not release any more medication, There is a dose indicator on the side of the inhaler that keeps track of how much medication is left in the cartridge. Check the dose indicator from time to time to see how much medication is left. When the pointer on the dose indicator enters the red area, the cartridge contains enough medication for 7 days and it is time to refill your prescription so that you will not run out of medication. Be careful not to get albuterol and ipratropium inhalation into your eyes. If you get albuterol and ipratropium in your eyes, you may develop narrow angle glaucoma (a serious eye condition that may cause loss of vision).

If you do not use your inhaler for more than 3 days, you will need to release one spray toward the ground before you start to use it again. If you do not use your inhaler for more than 21 days, you will need to follow steps 4-7 to prime the inhaler again. To inhale the spray using the inhaler, follow these steps: Hold the inhaler upright with the orange cap closed. Turn the clear base in the direction of the white arrows until it clicks.

Continue to breathe in as the spray is released into your mouth. Hold your breath for 10 seconds or as long as you comfortably can. Take the inhaler out of your mouth and close the orange cap.

Alendronate,"Why is this medication prescribed? Alendronate is used to treat and prevent osteoporosis (a condition in which the bones become thin and weak and break easily) in women who have undergone menopause (''change of life,'' end of menstrual periods) and to treat osteoporosis in men. Alendronate is also used to treat osteoporosis in men and women who are taking corticosteroids (a type of medication that may cause osteoporosis in some patients). Alendronate is also used to treat Paget's disease of bone (a condition in which the bones are soft and weak and may be deformed, painful, or easily broken). Alendronate is in a class of medications called bisphosphonates. It works by preventing bone breakdown and increasing bone density (thickness). How should this medicine be used? Alendronate comes as a tablet, an effervescent tablet, and a solution (liquid) to take by mouth. The solution is usually taken on an empty stomach once a week in the morning. The 5-mg and 10-mg tablets are usually taken on an empty stomach once a day in the morning, and the 35-mg and 70-mg tablets are usually taken on an empty stomach once a week in the morning. The 40-mg tablets are usually taken once a day in the morning for six months to treat Paget's disease of bone. The effervescent tablets are usually taken on an empty stomach once weekly in the morning. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take alendronate exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Alendronate may not work properly and may damage the esophagus (tube between the mouth and stomach) or cause sores in the mouth if it is not taken according to the following instructions. Tell your doctor if you do not understand, you do not think you will remember, or you are unable to follow these instructions: You must take alendronate just after you get out of bed in the morning, before you eat or drink anything. Never take alendronate at bedtime or before you wake up and get out of bed for the day. After you take alendronate, do not eat, drink, or take any other medications (including vitamins or antacids) for at least 30 minutes. Do not lie down for at least 30 minutes after you take alendronate. Sit upright or stand upright until at least 30 minutes have passed and you have eaten your first food of the day. If you are taking the alendronate tablets, swallow the tablet with a full glass (6 to 8 ounces [180 to 240 mL]) of plain water. Never take alendronate tablets with tea, coffee, juice, milk, mineral water, sparkling water, or any liquid other than plain water. Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew or crush them. Do not suck on the tablets. If you are taking the alendronate oral solution, drink at least 2 ounces (60 milliliters [1/4 cup]) of water after taking alendronate oral solution. Never take alendronate solution with tea, coffee, juice, milk, mineral water, sparkling water, or any liquid other than plain water. If you are taking the alendronate effervescent tablets, dissolve one effervescent tablet in a full glass (4 ounces [120 milliliters]) of plain, non-carbonated drinking water before drinking. Never dissolve alendronate effervescent tablets with tea, coffee, juice, milk, mineral water, sparkling water, or any liquid other than plain water. Wait at least 5 minutes after the effervescence stops, stir the solution for 10 seconds and drink it. Do not swallow, suck, or chew on the effervescent tablets. Alendronate controls osteoporosis and Paget's disease of bone but does not cure these conditions.  It may take 3 months or longer before your bone density begins to increase.

Moisten a piece of gauze dressing with saline and place it on the wound. The gauze should cover only the wound, not the skin around it. Place a small, dry pad dressing over the wound. Wrap a soft, dry gauze bandage over the pad and hold it in place with adhesive tape. Be careful not to attach the adhesive tape to your skin. After about 12 hours, remove the bandage and gauze dressing and rinse the ulcer gently with saline or water to remove whatever gel is left.

Continue to use beclomethasone even if you feel well. Do not stop using beclomethasone without talking to your doctor. Call your doctor if your symptoms or your child's symptoms do not improve during the first 4 weeks or if they get worse. Beclomethasone helps to prevent asthma attacks (sudden episodes of shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing) but will not stop an asthma attack that has already started. Your doctor will prescribe a short-acting inhaler to use during asthma attacks. Tell your doctor if your asthma worsens during your treatment. Do not use your beclomethasone inhaler when you are near a flame or source of heat. The inhaler may explode if it is exposed to very high temperatures. Each beclomethasone inhaler is designed to provide 50, 100, or 120 inhalations, depending on its size. After the labeled number of inhalations has been used, later inhalations may not contain the correct amount of medication. You should keep track of the number of inhalations you have used. You can divide the number of inhalations in your inhaler by the number of inhalations you use each day to find out how many days your inhaler will last. Throw away the inhaler after you have used the labeled number of inhalations even if it still contains some liquid and continues to release a spray when it is pressed. Before you use beclomethasone inhaler the first time, read the written instructions that come with the inhaler. Look at the diagrams carefully and be sure that you recognize all the parts of the inhaler. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you the right way to use the inhaler. Practice using the inhaler in front of him or her, so you are sure you are doing it the right way. To use the aerosol inhaler, follow these steps:
Keep the inhaler clean and dry with the cover tightly in place at all times. To clean your inhaler, use a clean, dry tissue or cloth. Do not wash or put any part of your inhaler in water. Remove the protective cap. If you are using the inhaler for the first time or if you have not used the inhaler in more than 10 days, prime it by releasing 2 test sprays into the air, away from your face. Be careful not to spray the medication into your eyes or face. Breathe out as completely as possible through your mouth. Hold the inhaler in the upright (mouthpiece up) or horizontal position. Place the mouthpiece between your lips well into your mouth. Tilt your head slightly back. Close your lips tightly around the mouthpiece keeping your tongue below it. Inhale slowly and deeply. Breathe in slowly and deeply through the mouthpiece. At the same time, press down once on the container to spray the medication into your mouth. When you have breathed in fully, remove the inhaler from your mouth and close your mouth. Try to hold your breath for about 5 to 10 seconds, then breathe out gently. If your doctor has told you to take more than 1 puff per treatment, repeat steps 3 through 7. Replace the protective cap on the inhaler. After each treatment, rinse your mouth with water and spit. Do not swallow the water. Other uses for this medicine This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.

Bedaquiline should not be used to treat TB that mainly affects other parts of the body. Bedaquiline is in a class of medications called anti-mycobacterials. It works by killing the bacteria that cause MDR-TB. How should this medicine be used? Bedaquiline comes as a tablet to take by mouth with water.

Continue to take bedaquiline until you finish the prescription and do not miss doses, even if you feel better. If you stop taking bedaquiline too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.

Betibeglogene autotemcel injection is in a class of medications called autologous gene therapy, a type of medication prepared using cells from the patient's own blood stem cells. It works by helping your body to produce enough red blood cells so that regular blood transfusions are not necessary. How should this medicine be used? Betibeglogene autotemcel injection comes as a suspension (liquid) to be injected intravenously (into a vein) by a doctor or nurse in a hospital. Betibeglogene autotemcel injection is given as a one-time dose administered over up to 2 hours. Before you receive your betibeglogene autotemcel dose, your doctor or nurse will administer other chemotherapy medications to prepare your body for betibeglogene autotemcel. Before your dose of betibeglogene autotemcel injection is to be given, a sample of your blood stem cells will be taken at a hospital or treatment center using a process called mobilization and apheresis (a process that removes blood stem cells from the body). This process usually takes about 1 week and may need to be repeated. The sample will be sent to the manufacturer to prepare a dose of betibeglogene autotemcel injection. It will take about 70â90 days from the time that your blood stem cells are collected before they are ready to be given to you. Because this medication is made from your own cells, it must be given only to you. You will have to stay in the hospital for about 3â6 weeks after you receive your betibeglogene autotemcel dose to monitor you for any side effects. Talk to your doctor about how to prepare for mobilization and apheresis and what to expect during and after the procedure. Betibeglogene autotemcel injection may cause infusion reactions, which may occur within 24 hours of receiving your dose.

Bexagliflozin,"Why is this medication prescribed? Bexagliflozin is used along with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar levels in adults with type 2 diabetes (condition in which blood sugar is too high because the body does not produce or use insulin normally). Bexagliflozin is in a class of medications called sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. It works by lowering blood sugar by causing the kidneys to get rid of more glucose in the urine. Bexagliflozin is not used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and, therefore, cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood). Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems.
Taking bexagliflozin, making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health.

Budesonide Oral Inhalation,"Why is this medication prescribed? Budesonide is used to prevent difficulty breathing, chest tightness, wheezing, and coughing caused by asthma. Budesonide powder for oral inhalation (Pulmicort Flexhaler) is used in adults and children 6 years of age and older. Budesonide suspension (liquid) for oral inhalation (Pulmicort Respules) is used in children 12 months to 8 years of age. Budesonide belongs to a class of medications called corticosteroids. It works by decreasing swelling and irritation in the airways to allow for easier breathing. How should this medicine be used? Budesonide comes as a powder to inhale by mouth using an inhaler and as a suspension to inhale by mouth using a special jet nebulizer (machine that turns medication into a mist that can be inhaled). Budesonide powder for oral inhalation is usually inhaled twice a day. Budesonide suspension for oral inhalation is usually inhaled once or twice a day. Try to use budesonide at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use budesonide exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Talk to your doctor about how you should use your other oral and inhaled medications for asthma during your treatment with budesonide inhalation. If you were taking an oral steroid such as dexamethasone, methylprednisolone (Medrol), or prednisone (Rayos), your doctor may want to gradually decrease your steroid dose starting after you begin to use budesonide. Budesonide controls symptoms of asthma but does not cure it. Improvement in your asthma may occur as soon after using the medication, but full effects of may not be seen for 1 to 2 weeks after using the powder and 4 to 6 weeks after using the suspension on a regular basis. Continue to use budesonide even if you feel well. Do not stop using budesonide without talking to your doctor. Call your doctor if your symptoms or your child's symptoms do not improve during the first 2 weeks (powder) or first 6 weeks (suspension) or if they get worse. Budesonide helps to prevent asthma attacks (sudden episodes of shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing) but will not stop an asthma attack that has already started. Your doctor will prescribe a short-acting inhaler to use during asthma attacks. Tell your doctor if your asthma worsens during your treatment. Each budesonide inhaler is designed to provide 60 or 120 inhalations, depending on its size. After the labeled number of inhalations has been used, later inhalations may not contain the correct amount of medication. You should keep track of the number of inhalations you have used. You can divide the number of inhalations in your inhaler by the number of inhalations you use each day to find out how many days your inhaler will last. Dispose of the inhaler after you have used the labeled number of inhalations even if it still contains some liquid and continues to release a spray when it is pressed. Do not swallow budesonide nebulizer suspension. Before you use budesonide inhaler or jet nebulizer the first time, read the written instructions that come with it. Look at the diagrams carefully and be sure that you recognize all the parts of the inhaler or nebulizer. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you the right way to use the inhaler or nebulizer. Practice using the inhaler or nebulizer in front of him or her, so you are sure you are doing it the right way. To inhale the powder using the inhaler, follow these steps: Turn the protective cover and lift it off. The first time you use a new budesonide inhaler you must prime it. To do this, hold the inhaler upright (with mouthpiece up), then twist the brown grip fully to the right as far as it will go, then back again fully to the left. You will hear a click. Repeat. The unit is now primed and ready to load the first dose. You do not have to prime the inhaler again after this, even if you do not use it for a long time. Holding the inhaler upright, load the first dose by turning the grip fully to the right and fully to the left until it clicks. Turn your head away from the inhaler and breathe out. Do not blow or exhale into the inhaler. Do not shake the inhaler after loading it. Hold the inhaler in the upright (mouthpiece up) or horizontal position. Place the mouthpiece between your lips well into your mouth. Tilt your head slightly back. Close your lips tightly around the mouthpiece, but do not bite or chew the mouthpiece. Inhale deeply and forcefully. Be sure that the mist goes into your throat and is not blocked by your teeth or tongue. Remove the inhaler from your mouth and hold your breath for about 10 seconds. Do not blow or exhale through the inhaler. If you are to inhale two puffs, repeat steps 4-6. For the next puff the inhaler must be loaded in the upright position right before its use. Turn the grip fully to the right and then fully to the left until it clicks. Replace the protective cap on the inhaler and twist it shut. After each treatment, rinse your mouth with water and spit. Do not swallow the water. Keep the inhaler clean and dry with the cover tightly in place at all times. To inhale the suspension using the jet nebulizer, follow these steps: Remove one ampule of inhalation suspension from the foil pouch. Gently shake the ampule in a circular motion. Hold the ampule upright and twist off the top of the ampule. Pour all of the liquid into the nebulizer reservoir. Do not mix other medications with budesonide in the reservoir. Connect the nebulizer reservoir to the mouthpiece or face mask. Connect the nebulizer to the compressor. Place the mouthpiece in your child's mouth or use the face mask. Have your child sit in an upright, comfortable position and turn on the compressor. Tell your child to breathe in calmly, deeply, and evenly until mist stops forming in the chamber. After each treatment, have your child rinse their mouth with water and spit; do not swallow the water. Dispose of the empty ampule and its top in a trash can that is out of the reach of children and pets. Clean your nebulizer regularly.

Buprenorphine Sublingual and Buccal (opioid dependence),"Why is this medication prescribed? Buprenorphine and the combination of buprenorphine and naloxone are used to treat opioid dependence (addiction to opioid drugs, including heroin and narcotic painkillers). Buprenorphine is in a class of medications called opioid partial agonist-antagonists and naloxone is in a class of medications called opioid antagonists. Buprenorphine alone and the combination of buprenorphine and naloxone work to prevent withdrawal symptoms when someone stops taking opioid drugs by producing similar effects to these drugs. How should this medicine be used? Buprenorphine comes as a sublingual tablet. The combination of buprenorphine and naloxone comes as a sublingual tablet (Zubsolv) and as a sublingual film (Suboxone) to take under the tongue or to apply between the gum and cheek. After your doctor determines an appropriate dose, these products are usually taken once a day.

Do not cut, tear, chew, swallow, touch or move the film while it dissolves. Do not eat or drink anything until the film dissolves completely. If you are using the sublingual film, rinse your mouth with water before you place the film. Place the film with a dry finger under your tongue to the right or left of the center and hold the film in place for 5 seconds. If you are using two films, place the other one on the opposite side under the tongue. Do not put the films on top of or near each other or let them touch each other. Do not use more than two films at one time. Do not cut, tear, chew, swallow, touch or move the film while it dissolves. Do not eat or drink anything until the film dissolves completely.

Bupropion,"IMPORTANT WARNING: For people taking bupropion (Wellbutrin) for depression: A small number of children, teenagers, and young adults (up to 24 years of age) who took antidepressants ('mood elevators') such as bupropion during clinical studies became suicidal (thinking about harming or killing oneself or planning or trying to do so). Children, teenagers, and young adults who take antidepressants to treat depression or other mental illnesses may be more likely to become suicidal than children, teenagers, and young adults who do not take antidepressants to treat these conditions. This risk should be considered and compared with the potential benefit in the treatment of depression, in deciding whether a child or teenager should take an antidepressant. Children younger than 18 years of age should not normally take bupropion, but in some cases, a doctor may decide that bupropion is the best medication to treat a child's condition. No matter what your age, before you take an antidepressant, you, your parent, or your caregiver should talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of treating your condition with an antidepressant or with other treatments. You should also talk about the risks and benefits of not treating your condition. You should know that having depression or another mental illness greatly increases the risk that you will become suicidal, especially at the beginning of your treatment or any time that your dose is increased or decreased. This risk is higher if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had bipolar disorder or mania or has thought about or attempted suicide. Talk to your doctor about your condition, symptoms, and personal and family medical history. You and your doctor will decide what type of treatment is right for you. You should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways when you take bupropion or other antidepressants even if you are an adult over age 24 or if you do not have a mental illness and you are taking bupropion to treat a different type of condition. You may become suicidal, especially at the beginning of your treatment and any time that your dose is increased or decreased. You, your family, or your caregiver should call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: new or worsening depression; thinking about harming or killing yourself, or planning or trying to do so; extreme worry; agitation; panic attacks; difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep; aggressive behavior; irritability; acting without thinking; severe restlessness; and frenzied abnormal excitement. Be sure that your family or caregiver knows which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor if you are unable to seek treatment on your own.

Bupropion (Zyban) is used to help people stop smoking. Bupropion is in a class of medications called antidepressants. It works by increasing certain types of activity in the brain. How should this medicine be used? Bupropion comes as a tablet and a sustained-release or extended-release (long-acting) tablet to take by mouth.

The extended-release tablet (Aplenzin, Wellbutrin XL) is usually taken once daily in the morning; doses of the extended-release tablet should be taken at least 24 hours apart.

Continue to take bupropion even if you feel well. Do not stop taking bupropion without talking to your doctor. Your doctor may decrease your dose gradually. Other uses for this medicine Bupropion is also sometimes used to treat episodes of depression in patients with bipolar disorder (manic depressive disorder; a disease that causes episodes of depression, episodes of mania, and other abnormal moods) and to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; more difficulty focusing, controlling actions, and remaining still or quiet than other people who are the same age).

Eculizumab Injection,"Notice: Eculizumab injection, eculizumab-aeeb injection, and eculizumab-aagh injection are biologic medications (medications made from living organisms).  Eculizumab-aeeb injection and eculizumab-aagh are considered to be ""biosimilar"" to eculizumab injection which means they work just as well and are just as safe to use as eculizumab injection. Eculizumab injection mentioned in the monograph below refers to any of these 3 products. IMPORTANT WARNING: Receiving eculizumab injection may increase the risk that you will develop a meningococcal infection (an infection that may affect the covering of the brain and spinal cord and/or may spread through the bloodstream) during your treatment or for some time afterward. Meningococcal infections may cause death in a short period of time. You will need to receive a meningococcal vaccine at least 2 weeks before you begin your treatment with eculizumab to decrease the risk that you will develop this type of infection. If you have received this vaccine in the past, you may need to receive a booster dose before you begin your treatment. If your doctor feels that you need to begin treatment with eculizumab right away, you will receive your meningococcal vaccine as soon as possible and take an antibiotic for as long as your doctor recommends. Even if you receive the meningococcal vaccine, there is still a risk that you may develop meningococcal disease during or after your treatment with eculizumab injection. Call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical help if you experience any of the following: headache that comes along with nausea or vomiting, fever, a stiff neck, or a stiff back; fever; rash and fever; fever with high heart rate; confusion; muscle aches and other flu-like symptoms; or if your eyes are sensitive to light. Tell your doctor if you have fever or other signs of infection before you begin your treatment with an eculizumab injection product. Your doctor will not give you eculizumab injection if you already have a meningococcal infection. Your doctor will give you a patient safety card with information about the risk of developing meningococcal disease during or for a period of time after your treatment. Carry this card with you at all times during your treatment and for 3 months after your treatment. Show the card to all healthcare providers who treat you so that they will know about your risk. Programs called Soliris REMS, BKEMV, or Epysqli REMS have been set up to decrease the risks of receiving an eculizumab injection product. You can only receive eculizumab injection from a doctor who has enrolled in one of these programs, has talked to you about the risks of meningococcal disease, has given you a patient safety card, and has made sure that you received a meningococcal vaccine.

Eculizumab injection is used to treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH: a type of anemia in which too many red blood cells are broken down in the body, so there are not enough healthy cells to bring oxygen to all parts of the body), atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS; an inherited condition in which small blood clots form in the body and may cause damage to the blood vessels, blood cells, kidneys, and other parts of the body),  a certain type of myasthenia gravis (MG; a disorder of the nervous system that causes muscle weakness), and a certain type of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD; an autoimmune disorder of the nervous system that affects eye nerves and the spinal cord).  Eculizumab injection is in a group of medications called immunotherapy. Eculizumab injection works by blocking the activity of the part of the immune system that may damage blood cells in people with PNH and that causes clots to form in people with aHUS. It also works by blocking the activity of the part of the immune system that may damage certain parts of the central nervous system in people with NMOSD or by disrupting communication between nerves and muscles in people with MG.

Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking eltrombopag. Why is this medication prescribed? Eltrombopag is used to increase the number of platelets (cells that help the blood clot) to decrease the risk of bleeding in adults and children 1 year of age and older who have chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP; an ongoing condition that may cause unusual bruising or bleeding due to an abnormally low number of platelets in the blood) and who have not been helped or cannot be treated with other treatments, including medications or surgery to remove the spleen. Eltrombopag is also used to increase the number of platelets in people who have hepatitis C (a viral infection that may damage the liver) so that they can begin and continue treatment with interferon (Peginterferon, Pegintron, others) and ribavirin (Rebetol). Eltrombopag is also used in combination with other medications to treat aplastic anemia (condition in which the body does not make enough new blood cells) in adults and children 2 years of age and older. It is also used to treat aplastic anemia in adults who have not been helped with other medications. Eltrombopag is used to increase the number of platelets enough to decrease the risk of bleeding in people with ITP or aplastic anemia, or to allow treatment with interferon and ribavirin in people with hepatitis C. However it is not used to increase the number of platelets to a normal level. Eltrombopag should not be used to treat people who have low numbers of platelets due to conditions other than ITP, hepatitis C, or aplastic anemia. Eltrombopag is in a class of medications called thrombopoietin receptor agonists. It works by causing the cells in the bone marrow to produce more platelets. How should this medicine be used? Eltrombopag comes as a tablet and as a powder for oral suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after eating. Take eltrombopag at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take eltrombopag exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Take eltrombopag at least 2 hours before or 4 hours after you eat or drink foods that contain a lot of calcium, such as dairy products, calcium-fortified juices, cereals, oatmeal, and breads; trout; clams; leafy green vegetables such as spinach and collard greens; and tofu and other soy products. Ask your doctor if you are not sure if a food contains a lot of calcium. You may find it helpful to take eltrombopag close to the beginning or end of your day so that you will be able to eat these foods during most of your waking hours. Swallow the tablets whole. Do not split, chew, or crush them and mix them into food or liquids. If you are taking the powder for oral suspension, carefully read the manufacturer's instructions for use that comes with the medication. These instructions describe how to prepare and measure your dose. Mix the powder with cool or cold water before use. Do not mix the powder with hot water. Immediately after preparation, swallow the dose. If it is not taken within 30 minutes or if there is remaining liquid, dispose of the mixture in the trash (do not pour it down the sink). Do not allow the powder to touch your skin. If you spill the powder on your skin, wash it off immediately with soap and water. Call your doctor if you have a skin reaction or if you have any questions. Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of eltrombopag and adjust your dose depending on your response to the medication. At the beginning of your treatment, your doctor will order a blood test to check your platelet level once every week. Your doctor may increase your dose if your platelet level is too low. If your platelet level is too high, your doctor may decrease your dose or may not give you eltrombopag for a time. After your treatment has continued for some time and your doctor has found the dose of eltrombopag that works for you, your platelet level will be checked less often. Your platelet level will also be checked weekly for at least 4 weeks after you stop taking eltrombopag. If you have chronic ITP, you may receive other medications to treat your condition along with eltrombopag. Your doctor may decrease your dose of these medications if eltrombopag works well for you. Eltrombopag does not work for everyone. If your platelet level does not increase enough after you have taken eltrombopag for some time, your doctor may tell you to stop taking eltrombopag. Eltrombopag may help to control your condition but will not cure it. Continue to take eltrombopag even if you feel well. Do not stop taking eltrombopag without talking to your doctor.

Enalapril,"IMPORTANT WARNING: Do not take enalapril if you are pregnant. If you become pregnant while taking enalapril, call your doctor immediately. Enalapril may harm the fetus. Why is this medication prescribed? Enalapril is used alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure. It is also used in combination with other medications to treat heart failure. Enalapril is in a class of medications called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. It works by decreasing certain chemicals that tighten the blood vessels, so blood flows more smoothly and the heart can pump blood more efficiently. High blood pressure is a common condition, and when not treated it can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys, and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation. How should this medicine be used? Enalapril comes as an immediate and extended-release (long-acting) tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once or twice a day with or without food.

Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients. tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking valsartan and sacubitril (Entresto) or if you have stopped taking it within the last 36 hours.

Eplontersen is used for the treatment of polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (an inherited condition in which abnormal proteins build up and deposit in tissues, resulting in nerve damage) in adults. Eplontersen is in a class of medications called antisense oligonucleotides. It works by decreasing the amount of abnormal proteins and the amount of abnormal protein deposited in the body's tissues, which decreases nerve damage. How should this medicine be used? Eplontersen comes as a solution (liquid) in a prefilled autoinjector to be given subcutaneously (under the skin). It is usually given once a month by the patient or caregiver at home. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you or the person who will be injecting the medication how to inject and prepare it. Remove the prefilled autoinjector from the refrigerator 30 minutes before planned administration time and allow to warm to room temperature in its original carton.

Check that the expiration date has not passed and that the liquid is clear or slightly yellow. The liquid should not contain visible particles.

You can inject eplontersen injection anywhere on the front of your thighs (upper leg) or abdomen (stomach) except your navel and the area 2 inches (5 centimeters) around it. If you have a caregiver to inject the medication, the back of the upper arm may also be used. To reduce the chances of soreness or redness, use a different site for each injection. Do not inject into an area where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard or where you have scars or stretch marks. Wash hands thoroughly and clean injection site with alcohol swab. Remove the clear cap by pulling it off while holding the autoinjector. Place the orange top of the autoinjector at a 90 degree angle to the skin with the viewing window visible to you. Push firmly and hold the autoinjector directly against the skin. You will hear a click when the injection starts. Continue to hold the autoinjector still against the skin for 10 seconds until the entire dose has been dispensed. Check to make sure the orange plunger is completely filling the viewing window to assure that the full dose has been given. Remove the autoinjector by lifting straight up and the orange needle shield will lock back into place and cover the needle.

"Epoetin Alfa, Injection","Notice: Epoetin alfa injection and epoetin alfa-epbx injection are biologic medications (medications made from living organisms). Biosimilar epoetin alfa-epbx injection is highly similar to epoetin alfa injection and works the same way as epoetin alfa injection in the body. Therefore, the term epoetin injection products will be used to represent these medications in this discussion. IMPORTANT WARNING: All patients: Using epoetin alfa injection products increases the risk that blood clots will form in or move to the legs, lungs, or brain. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had heart disease, a stroke, deep venous thrombosis (DVT; blood clot in your leg), a pulmonary embolus (PE; blood clot in your lungs), or if you are going to have surgery. Before having any surgery, even dental surgery, tell your doctor or dentist that you are being treated with an epoetin alfa injection product, especially if you are having coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery or orthopedic surgery. Your doctor may prescribe an anticoagulant ('blood thinner') to prevent clots from forming during surgery. Call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical help if you experience any of the following symptoms: pain, tenderness, redness, warmth, and/or swelling in the legs; coolness or paleness in an arm or leg; difficulty breathing or shortness of breath;  chest pain; sudden trouble speaking or understanding speech; sudden confusion; sudden weakness or numbness of an arm or leg (especially on one side of the body) or of the face; sudden trouble walking, dizziness, or loss of balance or coordination; or fainting. If you are being treated with hemodialysis (treatment to remove waste from the blood when the kidneys are not working), a blood clot may form in your vascular access (place where the hemodialysis tubing connects to your body). Tell your doctor if your vascular access is not working as usual. Your doctor will adjust your dose of an epoetin alfa injection product so that your hemoglobin level (amount of a protein found in red blood cells) is just high enough that you do not need a red blood cell transfusion (transfer of one person's red blood cells to another person's body to treat severe anemia). If you receive enough of an epoetin alfa product to increase your hemoglobin to a normal or near normal level, there is a greater risk that you will have a stroke or develop serious or life threatening heart problems including heart attack or heart failure. Call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical help if you experience any of the following symptoms: chest pain, squeezing pressure, or tightness; shortness of breath; nausea, lightheadedness, sweating, and other early signs of heart attack; discomfort or pain in the arms, shoulder, neck, jaw, or back; or swelling of the hands, feet, or ankles. Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain lab tests to check your body's response to epoetin alfa injection products. Your doctor may decrease your dose or tell you to stop using an epoetin alfa injection product for a period of time if the tests show that you are at high risk of experiencing serious side effects.

Cancer patients: In clinical studies, people with certain cancers who received epoetin alfa injection died sooner or experienced tumor growth, a return of their cancer, or cancer that spread sooner than people who did not receive the medication. You should only receive epoetin alfa injection products to treat anemia caused by chemotherapy if your chemotherapy is expected to continue for at least 2 months after you start your treatment with epoetin alfa injection and if there is not a high chance that your cancer will be cured.  Treatment with epoetin alfa injection products should be stopped when your course of chemotherapy ends. Surgical patients: You may be given an epoetin alfa injection product to decrease the risk that you will develop anemia and require a blood transfusion as a result of blood loss during certain types of surgery. However, receiving an epoetin alfa injection product before and after surgery may increase the risk that you will develop a dangerous blood clot during or after surgery. Your doctor will probably prescribe medication to help prevent blood clots. Why is this medication prescribed? Epoetin alfa injection products are used to treat anemia (a lower than normal number of red blood cells) in people with chronic kidney failure (condition in which the kidneys slowly and permanently stop working over a period of time). Epoetin alfa injection products are also used to treat anemia caused by chemotherapy in people with certain types of cancer or caused by zidovudine (AZT, Retrovir, in Trizivir, in Combivir), a medication used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Epoetin alfa injection products are also used before and after certain types of surgery to decrease the chance that blood transfusions (transfer of one person's blood to another person's body) will be needed because of blood loss during surgery. Epoetin alfa injection products should not be used to decrease the risk that transfusions will be needed in people who are having surgery on their hearts or blood vessels. Epoetin alfa injection products also should not be used to treat people who are able and willing to donate blood before surgery so that this blood can be replaced in their bodies during or after surgery. Epoetin alfa injection products cannot be used in place of a red blood cell transfusion to treat severe anemia and has not been shown to improve tiredness or poor well-being that may be caused by anemia. Epoetin alfa products are in a class of medications called erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). They work by causing the bone marrow (soft tissue inside the bones where blood is made) to make more red blood cells. How should this medicine be used? Epoetin alfa injection products come as a solution (liquid) to inject subcutaneously (just under the skin) or intravenously (into a vein). It is usually injected one to three times weekly. When epoetin alfa  injection products are used to decrease the risk that blood transfusions will be required due to surgery, it is sometimes injected once daily for 10 days before surgery, on the day of surgery and for 4 days after surgery. Alternatively, epoetin alfa injection products are sometimes injected once weekly, beginning 3 weeks before surgery and on the day of surgery.

Cannabidiol is in a class of medications called cannabinoids. It is not known exactly how cannabidiol works to prevent seizure activity. How should this medicine be used?

Your doctor will start you on a low dose of cannabidiol and gradually increase your dose, usually not more than once every week. Cannabidiol helps to control your condition, but does not cure it.

Cariprazine,"IMPORTANT WARNING: Important warning for older adults with dementia: Studies have shown that older adults with dementia (a brain disorder that affects the ability to remember, think clearly, communicate, and perform daily activities and that may cause changes in mood and personality) who take antipsychotics (medications for mental illness) such as cariprazine have an increased chance of death during treatment. Older adults with dementia may also have a greater chance of having a stroke or mini-stroke during treatment. Cariprazine is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of behavior disorders in older adults with dementia. Talk to the doctor who prescribed this medication if you, a family member, or someone you care for has dementia and is being treated with cariprazine. For more information visit the FDA website: https://www.fda.gov/Drugs . Important warning for people with episodes of depression: A small number of children, teenagers, and young adults (up to 24 years of age) who took antidepressants ('mood elevators') such as cariprazine during clinical studies became suicidal (thinking about harming or killing oneself or planning or trying to do so). Children, teenagers, and young adults who take antidepressants to treat depression or other mental illnesses may be more likely to become suicidal than children, teenagers, and young adults who do not take antidepressants to treat these conditions. However, there are also risks when depression is not treated in children and teenagers. Talk to your child's doctor about these risks and whether your child should take an antidepressant. Cariprazine has not been studied in children younger than 18 years of age. You should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways when you take cariprazine or other antidepressants even if you are an adult over 24 years of age.

Certolizumab Injection,"IMPORTANT WARNING: Certolizumab injection may decrease your ability to fight infection and increase the risk that you will get a serious or life-threatening infection including severe fungal, bacterial, and viral infections that may spread through the body. These infections may need to be treated in a hospital and may cause death. Tell your doctor if you often get any type of infection or if you have or think you may have any type of infection now. This includes minor infections (such as open cuts or sores), infections that come and go (such as cold sores), and chronic infections that do not go away. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had diabetes, hepatitis B (a viral infection that affects the liver), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or any condition that affects your immune system, and if you live or have ever lived in areas such as the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys where severe fungal infections are more common. Ask your doctor if you do not know if these infections are common in your area. Tell your doctor if you are taking medications that decrease the activity of the immune system. Your doctor will monitor you for signs of infection during and after your treatment. If you have any of the following symptoms before you begin your treatment or if you experience any of the following symptoms during or shortly after your treatment, call your doctor immediately: sore throat; cough; coughing up bloody mucus; fever; stomach pain; diarrhea; flu-like symptoms; open cuts or sores; weight loss; weakness; sweating; difficulty breathing; difficult, frequent, or painful urination; or other signs of infection. You may already be infected with tuberculosis (TB; a serious lung infection) or hepatitis B (a virus that affects the liver) but not have any symptoms of the disease. In this case, using certolizumab injection may make your infection more serious and cause you to develop symptoms. Your doctor will perform a skin test to see if you have an inactive TB infection and may order a blood test to see if you have an inactive hepatitis B infection. If necessary, your doctor will give you medication to treat this infection before you start using certolizumab. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had TB, if you have lived in or visited a country where TB is common, or if you have been around someone who has TB. If you have any of the following symptoms of TB, or if you develop any of these symptoms during your treatment, call your doctor immediately: cough, weight loss, loss of muscle tone, or fever. Also call your doctor immediately if you have any of these symptoms of hepatitis B or if you develop any of these symptoms during or after your treatment: excessive tiredness, yellowing of the skin or eyes, loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting, muscle aches, dark urine, clay-colored bowel movements, fever, chills, stomach pain, or rash. Some children and teenagers who received medications similar to certolizumab injection developed severe or life-threatening cancers including lymphoma (cancer that begins in the cells that fight infection). Some teenage and young adult males who took certolizumab or similar medications developed hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a very serious form of cancer that often causes death within a short period of time. Most of the people who developed HSTCL were being treated for Crohn's disease (a condition in which the body attacks the lining of the digestive tract, causing pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and fever) or ulcerative colitis (a condition which causes swelling and sores in the lining of the colon [large intestine] and rectum) with certolizumab or a similar medication along with another medication called azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine. Adults who use certolizumab injection may also be at greater risk of developing certain types of cancer, including skin cancer. Tell your doctor if you or your child have ever had any type of cancer. If you or your child develop any of these symptoms during treatment, call your doctor immediately: unexplained weight loss; swollen glands in the neck, underarms, or groin; easy bruising or bleeding; a new skin lesion or bump; or a change in the size or color of a mole. Your doctor will also check your skin for any changes during your treatment.

Talk to your doctor about the risks of using certolizumab injection. Why is this medication prescribed? Certolizumab injection is used to treat Crohn's disease (a condition in which the body attacks the lining of the digestive tract, causing pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and fever) that has not improved when treated with other medications in adults. Certolizumab injection is also used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (a condition in which the body attacks its own joints, causing pain, swelling, and loss of function), psoriatic arthritis (a condition that causes joint pain and swelling and scales on the skin), active ankylosing spondylitis (a condition in which the body attacks the joints of the spine and other areas causing pain, swelling, and joint damage) with changes seen on X-ray, active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (a condition in which the body attacks the joints of the spine and other areas causing pain and signs of swelling), but without changes seen on X-ray, and plaque psoriasis (a skin disease in which red, scaly patches form on some areas of the body) in people who may benefit from medications or phototherapy (a treatment that involves exposing the skin to ultraviolet light) in adults. Certolizumab injection is also used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (PJIA; a type of childhood arthritis that affects five or more joints during the first six months of the condition, causing pain, swelling, and loss of function) in children 2 years of age or older. Certolizumab injection is in a class of medications called tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. It works by blocking the activity of TNF, a substance in the body that causes inflammation. How should this medicine be used? Certolizumab injection comes as a powder to be mixed with sterile water and injected subcutaneously (just under the skin) by a doctor or nurse in a medical office and as a prefilled syringe that you can inject subcutaneously by yourself at home. When certolizumab injection is used to treat Crohn's disease, it is usually given every two weeks for the first three doses and then every four weeks for as long as treatment continues. When certolizumab injection is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or axial spondyloarthritis, it is usually given every 2 weeks for the first three doses and then every 2 or 4 weeks for as long as treatment continues. When certolizumab injection is used to treat plaque psoriasis or polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, it is usually given every 2 weeks. If you are injecting certolizumab injection yourself, follow the directions on your prescription label carefully. Do not inject more or less certolizumab than prescribed by your doctor. If you will be injecting certolizumab injection by yourself at home or having a friend or relative inject the medication for you, ask your doctor to show you or the person who will be injecting the medication how to inject it. You and the person who will be injecting the medication should also read the written instructions for use that come with the medication. If you are using a prefilled syringe that has been refrigerated, place it on a flat surface and allow it warm to room temperature for about 30 minutes before you are ready to inject the medication. Do not try to warm the medication by heating it in a microwave, placing it in hot water, or through any other method. Do not shake the prefilled syringe that contains certolizumab. Before you open the package containing your medication, check to be sure that the package is not torn, that the tamper-evident seals on the top and bottom of the package are not missing or broken and that the expiration date printed on the package has not passed. After you open the package, look closely at the liquid in the syringe. The liquid should be clear or pale yellow and should not contain large, colored particles. Call your pharmacist, if there are any problems with the package or the syringe. Do not inject the medication.

Chlorpropamide,"Notice: Chlorpropamide is no longer available in the United States. Why is this medication prescribed? Chlorpropamide is used along with diet and exercise, and sometimes with other medications, to treat type 2 diabetes (condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and, therefore, cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood). Chlorpropamide is in a class of medications called sulfonylureas. Chlorpropamide lowers blood sugar by causing the pancreas to produce insulin (a natural substance that is needed to break down sugar in the body) and helping the body use insulin efficiently. This medication will only help lower blood sugar in people whose bodies produce insulin naturally. Chlorpropamide is not used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and, therefore, cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) or diabetic ketoacidosis (a serious condition that may occur if high blood sugar is not treated). Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Taking medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease. Your doctor and other healthcare providers will talk to you about the best way to manage your diabetes. How should this medicine be used? Chlorpropamide comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with breakfast once a day. Tell your doctor if chlorpropamide upsets your stomach. Your doctor may tell you to take smaller doses of chlorpropamide twice a day with meals.

Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take chlorpropamide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of chlorpropamide and gradually increase your dose if needed. After you have taken chlorpropamide for some time, chlorpropamide may not control your blood sugar as well as it did at the beginning of your treatment. Your doctor may adjust the dose of your medication as needed so that the medication will work best for you. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling and if your blood sugar test results have been higher or lower than normal at any time during your treatment.

Cholera Vaccine,"Why get vaccinated? Cholera is a disease that can cause severe diarrhea and vomiting. If it isn't treated quickly, it can lead to dehydration and even death. About 100,000-130,000 people are thought to die from cholera each year, almost all of them in countries where the disease is common. Cholera is caused by bacteria and spread through contaminated food or water. It isn't usually spread directly from person to person, but it can be spread through contact with the feces of an infected person. Cholera is very rare among U.S. citizens. It is a risk mostly to people traveling in countries where the disease is common (mainly Haiti, and parts of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific). It has also occurred in the United States among people eating raw or undercooked seafood from the Gulf Coast. Being careful about what you eat and drink while traveling and practicing good personal hygiene, can help prevent waterborne and foodborne diseases, including cholera. For someone who has been infected, rehydration (replacing water and chemicals lost through diarrhea or vomiting) can greatly reduce the chance of dying. Vaccination can reduce the risk of getting sick from cholera. Cholera vaccine The cholera vaccine used in the United States is an oral (swallowed) vaccine. Only one dose is needed. Booster doses are not recommended at this time. Most travelers do not need cholera vaccine. If you are an adult 18 through 64 years old traveling to an area where people are getting infected with cholera, your health care provider might recommend the vaccine for you. In clinical studies, cholera vaccine was very effective in preventing severe or life-threatening cholera. However, it is not 100% effective against cholera and does not protect from other foodborne or waterborne diseases. Cholera vaccine is not a substitute for being careful about what you eat or drink. Who should not receive the cholera vaccine? Tell the person who is giving you the vaccine: If you have any severe, life-threatening allergies. If you have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction after a previous dose of any cholera vaccine, or if you have a severe allergy to any ingredient in this vaccine, you should not get the vaccine. Tell your health care provider if you have any severe allergies that you know of. He or she can tell you about the vaccine's ingredients. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding. Not much is known about the potential risks of this vaccine for a pregnant or breastfeeding woman. A registry has been set up to learn more about vaccination during pregnancy. If you get the vaccine and later learn you were pregnant at the time, you are encouraged to contact this registry at 1-800-533-5899 . If you've recently taken antibiotics. Antibiotics taken within 14 days before vaccination may cause the vaccine to not work as well. If you are taking antimalaria drugs. Cholera vaccine should not be taken with the antimalarial medication chloroquine (Aralen Â® ). It is best to wait at least 10 days after the vaccine to take antimalaria drugs. Always wash your hands thoroughly after using the bathroom and before preparing or handling food. Cholera vaccine can be shed in feces for at least 7 days. If you have a mild illness, like a cold, you can probably get the vaccine today. If you are moderately or severely ill, your doctor might recommend waiting until you recover. What are the risks of a vaccine reaction? With any medicine, including vaccines, there is a chance of reactions. These are usually mild and go away on their own within a few days, but serious reactions are also possible. Some people have mild problems following cholera vaccination. These include the following: abdominal pain tiredness or fatigue headache lack of appetite nausea or diarrhea No serious problems reported after cholera vaccine were considered related to the vaccine. Any medication can cause a severe allergic reaction. Such reactions from a vaccine are very rare, estimated at about 1 in a million doses, and would happen within a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination. As with any medicine, there is a very remote chance of a vaccine causing a serious injury or death. The safety of vaccines is always being monitored. For more information, visit: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/index.html . What if there is a serious reaction? Look for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or unusual behavior. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness.

Accumulation of cholesterol and fats along the walls of your arteries (a process known as atherosclerosis) decreases blood flow and, therefore, the oxygen supply to your heart, brain, and other parts of your body. Lowering your blood level of cholesterol and fats may help to prevent heart disease, angina (chest pain), strokes, and heart attacks.

These symptoms include sneezing and stuffy, runny or itchy nose. Ciclesonide is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It works by preventing and decreasing inflammation (swelling that can cause other symptoms) in the nose. How should this medicine be used?

Your symptoms probably will not begin to improve for at least 24-48 hours after your first dose and it may be longer before you feel the full benefit of ciclesonide. Continue to use ciclesonide even if you feel well. Do not stop taking ciclesonide without talking to your doctor. Each bottle of ciclesonide nasal spray is designed to provide 120 sprays after the bottle is primed initially. The bottle must be disposed of after 4 months of use. You should count 4 months from the date that the bottle is removed from the foil pouch and write it on the sticker that is provided in the carton.

If you are using any other inhaled medications, ask your doctor if you should inhale these medications a certain amount of time before and after you inhale ciclesonide inhalation. If you were taking an oral steroid such as dexamethasone, methylprednisolone (Medrol), or prednisone (Rayos), your doctor may want to gradually decrease your steroid dose starting at least one week after you begin to use ciclesonide inhalation. Ciclesonide inhalation helps to prevent asthma attacks (sudden episodes of shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing) but will not stop an asthma attack that has already started. Do not use ciclesonide inhalation during an asthma attack. Your doctor will prescribe a short-acting inhaler to use during asthma attacks. Your doctor will probably start you on an average dose of ciclesonide inhalation.

When the number that shows on the counter is 20, you should call your doctor or pharmacist to refill your prescription. When the number that shows on the counter is 0, you should not use that canister anymore. You should also keep track of the number of inhalations you use each day to know the exact amount of sprays that remain in your inhaler. Throw away the canister after you have used the labeled number of inhalations even if it still contains some liquid and continues to release a spray when it is pressed. If your inhaler is dropped, do not use the number on the counter to predict the number of sprays left in your inhaler. Before you use your ciclesonide aerosol inhaler the first time, read the written instructions that come with it. Look at the diagrams carefully and be sure that you recognize all the parts of the inhaler. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you how to use it.

To use the aerosol, follow these steps: Be sure that the inhaler is at room temperature. Remove the cap from the mouthpiece. Be sure the canister is fully and firmly inserted in the actuator. You do not need to shake your inhaler before each use. If you are using the inhaler for the first time or if you have not used the inhaler in more than 10 days, prime it by releasing 3 test sprays into the air, away from your face. Be careful not to spray the medication into your eyes or face. Breathe out through your mouth. Hold the inhaler facing you with the mouthpiece on the bottom. Place your thumb under the mouthpiece and your index finger on the center of the dose indicator at the top of the canister. Place the mouthpiece in your mouth and close your lips around it, keeping your tongue below it. Breathe in deeply and slowly through your mouth. At the same time, press down firmly with your index finger on the center of the dose indicator at the top of the canister to deliver your dose. When you have breathed in fully, try to hold your breath for about 10 seconds, remove the inhaler from your mouth, and then breathe out gently. Put the cap back on the mouthpiece.

Citalopram,"IMPORTANT WARNING: A small number of children, teenagers, and young adults (up to 24 years of age) who took antidepressants ('mood elevators') such as citalopram during clinical studies became suicidal (thinking about harming or killing oneself or planning or trying to do so). Children, teenagers, and young adults who take antidepressants to treat depression or other mental illnesses may be more likely to become suicidal than children, teenagers, and young adults who do not take antidepressants to treat these conditions. However, experts are not sure about how great this risk is and how much it should be considered in deciding whether a child or teenager should take an antidepressant. Children younger than 18 years of age should not normally take citalopram, but in some cases, a doctor may decide that citalopram is the best medication to treat a child's condition. You should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways when you take citalopram or other antidepressants even if you are an adult over 24 years of age. You may become suicidal, especially at the beginning of your treatment and any time that your dose is increased or decreased.

Clindamycin Injection,"IMPORTANT WARNING: Many antibiotics, including clindamycin, may cause overgrowth of dangerous bacteria in the large intestine. This may cause mild diarrhea or may cause a life-threatening condition called colitis (inflammation of the large intestine). Clindamycin is more likely to cause this type of infection than many other antibiotics, so it should only be used to treat serious infections that cannot be treated by other antibiotics. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had colitis or other conditions that affect your stomach or intestine. You may develop these problems during your treatment or up to several months after your treatment has ended. Call your doctor if you experience any of the following symptoms during your treatment with clindamycin injection or during the first several months after your treatment is finished: watery or bloody stools, diarrhea, stomach cramps, or fever. Talk to your doctor about the risks of receiving clindamycin injection. Why is this medication prescribed? Clindamycin injection is used to treat certain types of bacterial infections, including infections of the lungs, skin, blood, bones, joints, female reproductive organs, and internal organs. Clindamycin is in a class of medications called lincomycin antibiotics. It works by slowing or stopping the growth of bacteria. Antibiotics such as clindamycin will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment. How should this medicine be used? Clindamycin injection comes as a liquid to be injected intravenously (into a vein) over a period of 10 to 40 minutes or intramuscularly (into a muscle). It is usually given two to four times a day. The length of your treatment depends on the type of infection you have and how well you respond to the medication. You may receive clindamycin injection in a hospital, or you may be given the medication to use at home. If you have been told to use clindamycin injection at home, it is very important that you use the medication exactly as directed. Use clindamycin injection at about the same times every day. Follow the directions that you are given carefully, and ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you have any questions. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with clindamycin injection. If your symptoms do not improve or if they get worse, call your doctor. Use clindamycin injection until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop using clindamycin injection too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics. Other uses for this medicine Clindamycin injection is also sometimes used to treat malaria (a serious infection spread by mosquitoes in some parts of the world) and to prevent infection in people who are having certain types of surgery. Clindamycin injection is also sometimes used to treat anthrax (a serious infection that may be spread as part of a bioterror attack) and toxoplasmosis (an infection that may cause serious problems in people who do not have healthy immune systems and in unborn babies whose mothers are infected). Clindamycin injection is also used in some pregnant women to prevent passing an infection to the baby during birth.

Clobazam,"Notice: Special Alert: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is warning that the antiseizure medicines levetiracetam (Keppra Â® , Keppra Â® XR, Elepsia Â® XR, Spritam Â® ) and clobazam (Onfi Â® , Sympazan Â® ), can cause a rare but serious reaction that can be life-threatening if not diagnosed and treated quickly. This reaction is called Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS). It may start as a rash but can quickly progress, resulting in injury to internal organs, the need for hospitalization, and even death. As a result, FDA is requiring warnings about this risk to be added to the prescribing information and patient Medication Guides for these medicines. This hypersensitivity reaction to these medicines is serious but rare. DRESS can include fever, rash, swollen lymph nodes, or injury to organs including the liver, kidneys, lungs, heart, or pancreas. Talk to your doctor about any concerns you have regarding your treatment. IMPORTANT WARNING: Clobazam may increase the risk of serious or life-threatening breathing problems, sedation, or coma if used along with certain medications. Tell your doctor if you are taking or plan to take: antidepressants; medications for anxiety, mental illness, and seizures; sedatives; sleeping pills; opioids such as codeine, fentanyl (Duragesic Â® , Subsys Â® ), morphine (Astramorph Â® , Kadian Â® ), or oxycodone (in Percocet Â® , in Roxicet Â® , others); or tranquilizers. Your doctor may need to change the dosages of your medications and will monitor you carefully. If you take clobazam with any of these medications and you develop any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately or seek emergency medical care immediately: unusual dizziness, lightheadedness, extreme sleepiness, slowed or difficult breathing, or unresponsiveness. Be sure that your caregiver or family members know which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor or emergency medical care if you are unable to seek treatment on your own. Clobazam may be habit forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or for a longer time than your doctor tells you to. Tell your doctor if you have ever drunk large amounts of alcohol, if you use or have ever used street drugs, or have overused prescription medications. Do not drink alcohol or use street drugs during your treatment. Drinking alcohol or using street drugs during your treatment with clobazam also increases the risk that you will experience these serious, life-threatening side effects. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had depression or another mental illness. Clobazam may cause a physical dependence (a condition in which unpleasant physical symptoms occur if a medication is suddenly stopped or taken in smaller doses), especially if you take it for several days to several weeks. Do not stop taking this medication or take fewer doses without talking to your doctor. Stopping clobazam suddenly can worsen your condition and cause withdrawal symptoms that may last for several weeks to more than 12 months. Your doctor will probably decrease your clobazam dose gradually. Call your doctor or get emergency medical treatment if you experience any of the following symptoms: unusual movements; ringing in your ears; anxiety; memory problems; difficulty concentrating; sleep problems; seizures; shaking; muscle twitching; changes in mental health; depression; burning or prickling feeling in hands, arms, legs or feet; seeing or hearing things that others do not see or hear; thoughts of harming or killing yourself or others; overexcitement; or losing touch with reality. Why is this medication prescribed? Clobazam is used with other medication(s) to control seizures in adults and children 2 years of age and older who have Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (a disorder that causes seizures and often causes developmental delays). Clobazam is in a class of medications called benzodiazepines. It works by decreasing abnormal electrical activity in the brain. How should this medicine be used? Clobazam comes as a tablet and a suspension (liquid) to take by mouth, and as a film to apply on the tongue. It is usually taken once or twice a day, with or without food. Take clobazam at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. If you are unable to swallow the tablets whole, you may break them in half on the score mark or crush and mix them with a small amount of applesauce. The liquid comes an adapter and two oral dosing syringes. Use only one of the two oral dosing syringes to measure your dose and save the second syringe. If the first oral syringe is damaged or lost, the second provided syringe may be used as a replacement. To take the liquid, follow these steps: Before the first use, uncap the bottle and firmly insert the adapter into the neck of the bottle until the adapter top is even with the bottle top. Do not remove the adapter during the period of time you are using this bottle. Shake the liquid well before each use to mix the medication evenly. To measure your dose, push the plunger of the syringe all the way down and insert the syringe into the adapter of the upright bottle. Then turn the bottle upside down and slowly pull the plunger back until the black ring is in line with your prescribed dose. Remove the syringe from the bottle adapter and slowly squirt the liquid from the syringe into the corner of your mouth. Place the bottle cap over the adapter after each use. Wash the oral syringe after each use. To wash the syringe, remove the plunger completely, wash the barrel and plunger with soap and water, rinse, and allow to dry. Do not place the syringe parts in the dishwasher. To take the film, follow these steps: Open the foil pouch and remove the film. Be sure that your hands are dry and clean. Place the film on the top of your tongue. Close your mouth and swallow your saliva normally. Do not chew, spit, or talk while the film dissolves. Do not take with liquids. Wash your hands. If your doctor has told you to take more than one film per dose, wait until the first film has completely dissolved before applying the second film. Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of clobazam and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every week. Some people may respond differently to clobazam based on their heredity or genetic makeup. Your doctor may order a blood test to help find the dose of clobazam that is best for you. Clobazam may help control your condition but will not cure it. Continue to take clobazam even if you feel well. Do not stop taking clobazam without talking to your doctor. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with clobazam and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.

If you become pregnant while taking clobazam, call your doctor. if you are using hormonal contraceptives (birth control pills, patches, rings, implants, injections, or intrauterine devices), you should know that this type of birth control may not work well when used with clobazam.

Some of these people developed suicidal thoughts and behavior as early as one week after they started taking the medication. You and your doctor will decide whether the risks of taking an anticonvulsant medication are greater than the risks of not taking the medication. You, your family, or your caregiver should call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: panic attacks; agitation or restlessness; new or worsening irritability, anxiety, or depression; acting on dangerous impulses; difficulty falling or staying asleep; aggressive, angry, or violent behavior; mania (frenzied, abnormally excited mood); thinking about harming or killing yourself, or planning or trying to do so; or any other unusual changes in behavior or mood.

Children younger than 18 years of age should not normally take clomipramine, but in some cases, a doctor may decide that clomipramine is the best medication to treat a child's condition. You should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways when you take clomipramine or other antidepressants even if you are an adult over age 24.

Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation. How should this medicine be used? Clonidine comes as a tablet, an extended-release (long-acting) tablet, and an extended-release oral suspension to take by mouth with or without food. The tablet is usually taken two times a day at evenly spaced intervals. If the extended-release tablet is used to treat high blood pressure, it is usually taken once a day. If the extended-release tablet is taken to treat ADHD, it is usually taken once or twice a day. The extended-release oral suspension is usually taken once a day at bedtime. Take clonidine at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take clonidine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the extended-release tablets whole; do not split, chew or crush them. To take the extended-release oral suspension, follow these steps: Before the first use, uncap the bottle and firmly insert the adapter into the neck of the bottle until the adapter top is even with the bottle top. Do not remove the adapter during the period of time you are using this bottle. Then, replace the cap by turning clockwise. Shake the bottle gently up and down for at least 10 seconds to mix the medication evenly before each time your take the medication. To measure your dose, push the plunger of the syringe all the way down and insert the syringe into the adapter of the upright bottle. Then turn the bottle upside down and slowly pull the plunger back to withdraw the amount of suspension prescribed by the doctor.

If you see air bubbles in the syringe, push and pull the plunger in and out until the air bubbles are mostly gone. Tap the barrel of the syringe to get rid of any remaining air bubbles. Remove the syringe from the bottle adapter and slowly squirt the suspension into your mouth or your child's mouth and toward the inside of their cheek.

Wash the oral syringe after each use by rinsing with water and allow to dry. Your doctor may start you on a low dose of clonidine and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every week.

If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: extreme tiredness; weakness; fever, sore throat, chills, or other signs of flu or infection; unusual vaginal discharge or itching; sores in your mouth or throat; wounds that take a long time to heal; pain or burning while urinating; sores or pain in or around your rectal area; or abdominal pain. Clozapine may cause seizures. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had seizures, a head injury, or if you drink large amounts of alcohol. Do not drive a car, operate machinery, swim, or climb while taking clozapine, because if you suddenly lose consciousness, you could harm yourself or others. If you experience a seizure, call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment. Clozapine may cause serious or life-threatening heart inflammation or swelling. Clozapine may also cause your heart to enlarge or harden.  This may cause the heart to be unable to pump blood normally.
If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: extreme tiredness; flu-like symptoms;
swollen legs, ankles, or feet;
difficulty breathing or fast breathing; fever; chest pain; dizziness; or fast, irregular, or pounding heartbeat.

For more information visit https://www.fda.gov/Drugs Why is this medication prescribed? Clozapine is used to treat schizophrenia (a mental illness that affects how a person thinks, feels or behaves) in certain people. Clozapine is in a class of medications called atypical antipsychotics. It works by changing the activity of certain natural substances in the brain. How should this medicine be used? Clozapine comes as a tablet, an orally disintegrating tablet (tablet that dissolves quickly in the mouth), and an oral suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken once or twice daily. Take clozapine at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take clozapine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Do not try to push the orally disintegrating tablet through the foil packaging. Instead, use dry hands to peel back the foil. Immediately take out the tablet and place it on your tongue. The tablet will quickly dissolve and can be swallowed with saliva. No water is needed to swallow disintegrating tablets. To measure clozapine oral suspension, follow these steps: Make sure the cap is tight on the oral suspension container by turning the cap clockwise (to the right). Shake the bottle up and down for 10 seconds before use. Remove the bottle cap by pushing down on the cap, then turn it counterclockwise (to the left). The first time you open a new bottle, push the adaptor into the bottle until the top of the adaptor is lined up with the top of the bottle. If your dose is 1 mL or less, use the smaller (1 mL) oral syringe. If your dose is more than 1 mL, use the larger (9 mL) oral syringe. Fill the oral syringe with by air by drawing back the plunger. Then insert the open tip of the oral syringe into the adaptor. Push all the air from the oral syringe into the bottle by pushing down on the plunger. While holding the oral syringe in place, carefully turn the bottle upside down. Draw some of the medication out of the bottle into the oral syringe by pulling back on the plunger. Be careful not to pull the plunger all the way out. You will see a small amount of air near the end of the plunger in the oral syringe. Push on the plunger so the medication goes back into the bottle and the air disappears. Pull back on the plunger to draw your correct medication dose into the oral syringe. While still holding the oral syringe in the bottle, carefully turn the bottle upwards so the syringe is on top. Remove the oral syringe from the bottle neck adaptor without pushing on the plunger. Take the medication right after you draw it into the oral syringe. Do not prepare a dose and store it in the syringe for later use. Place the open tip of the oral syringe into one side of your mouth. Tightly close your lips around the oral syringe and push on the plunger slowly as the liquid goes into your mouth. Swallow the medication slowly as it goes into your mouth. Leave the adaptor in the bottle. Place the cap back on the bottle and turn it clockwise (to the right) to tighten it. Rinse the oral syringe with warm tap water after each use. Fill a cup with water and place the tip of the oral syringe into the water in the cup. Pull back on the plunger and draw the water into the oral syringe. Push on the plunger to squirt the water into a sink or a separate container until the oral syringe is clean. Allow the oral syringe air dry and dispose of any leftover rinse water. Clozapine controls schizophrenia but does not cure it. It may take several weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of clozapine. Continue to take clozapine even if you feel well.

Colesevelam,"Why is this medication prescribed? Colesevelam is used in adults along with diet, weight loss, and exercise to reduce the amount of cholesterol and certain fatty substances in the blood alone or in combination with other cholesterol-lowering medications known as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). Colesevelam is also used alone or in combination with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in certain boys and in girls, ages 10 to 17, with familial heterozygous hypercholesterolemia (an inherited condition in which cholesterol cannot be removed from the body normally) to decrease the amount of cholesterol and other fatty substances in the blood. Colesevelam is also used along with diet and exercise to control blood sugar levels in adults with type 2 diabetes (condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood). Colesevelam is in a class of medications called bile acid sequestrants. It works by binding bile acids in your intestines to form a product that is removed from the body. Bile acids are made when cholesterol is broken down in your body. Removing these bile acids helps to lower your blood cholesterol. Accumulation of cholesterol and fats along the walls of your arteries (a process known as atherosclerosis) decreases blood flow and, therefore, the oxygen supply to your heart, brain, and other parts of your body. Lowering your blood level of cholesterol and fats may help prevent heart disease, angina (chest pain), strokes, and heart attacks. How should this medicine be used? Colesevelam comes as a tablet, in a chewable bar, and as a powder to be mixed with a liquid to take by mouth. The tablets are usually taken once or twice a day with meals and a beverage.

Why is this medication prescribed? Cyclosporine and cyclosporine (modified) are used with other medications to prevent transplant rejection (attack of the transplanted organ by the immune system of the person who received the organ) in people who have received kidney, liver, and heart transplants. Cyclosporine (modified) is also used alone or with methotrexate (Rheumatrex) to treat the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (arthritis caused by swelling of the lining of the joints) in patients whose symptoms were not relieved by methotrexate alone. Cyclosporine (modified) is also used to treat psoriasis (a skin disease in which red, scaly patches form on some areas of the body) in certain patients who have not been helped by other treatments. Cyclosporine and cyclosporine (modified) are in a class of medications called immunosuppressants. They work by decreasing the activity of the immune system. How should this medicine be used? Cyclosporine and cyclosporine (modified) both come as a capsule and a solution (liquid) to take by mouth. Cyclosporine is usually taken once a day. Cyclosporine (modified) is usually taken twice a day. It is important to take both types of cyclosporine on a regular schedule.

If you are taking cyclosporine (modified) to treat psoriasis, it may take 2 weeks or longer for your symptoms to begin to improve, and 12 to 16 weeks for you to feel the full benefit of the medication. If you are taking cyclosporine (modified) to treat rheumatoid arthritis, it may take 4 to 8 weeks for your symptoms to improve. Continue to take cyclosporine (modified) even if you feel well. Do not stop taking cyclosporine (modified) without talking to your doctor. Your doctor may decrease your dose gradually.

Dabigatran is used to treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT; a blood clot, usually in the leg) and pulmonary embolism (PE; a blood clot in the lung) in adults and children 3 months of age and older who have been treated with an injectable anticoagulant ('blood thinner'). It is also used to reduce the risk of a DVT and PE from happening again after initial treatment is completed in adults and children 3 months of age and older.  Dabigatran is used to help prevent DVT and PE in adults who have had hip replacement surgery. Dabigatran is also used to help prevent strokes or serious blood clots in adults who have atrial fibrillation (a condition in which the heart beats irregularly, increasing the chance of clots forming in the body, and possibly causing strokes) without heart valve disease. Dabigatran is in a class of anticoagulant medications called direct thrombin inhibitors. It works by preventing blood clots from forming in the body. How should this medicine be used? Dabigatran comes as a capsule and pellets to take by mouth. When dabigatran is used to treat or prevent a DVT or PE or to prevent strokes or serious blood clots in people who have atrial fibrillation, it is usually taken twice a day. When dabigatran is used to prevent a DVT or PE after hip replacement surgery, it is usually taken 1 to 4 hours after surgery, and then once a day for another 28 to 35 days.

Do not mix the pellets with milk or foods that contain milk products. To prepare a dose of dabigatran pellets with soft food, sprinkle the entire packet of pellets on soft food such as baby rice cereal (prepared with water), mashed carrots, mashed banana, or applesauce. Give the entire mixture within 30 minutes of sprinkling the pellets on the soft food. Alternatively you can give dabigatran pellets to your child along with apple juice. Spoon the pellets into your child's mouth and offer them as much apple juice as necessary to swallow the pellets. Or you can mix the pellets in small amount of apple juice and have your child drink the entire mixture. If pellets stick to the cup, add a small amount of apple juice and give it to your child. Repeat as necessary until all of the pellets are gone. Do not store the mixture of dabigatran pellets and soft food or apple juice; use within 30 minutes after mixing. If your child does not take the entire dose of dabigatran pellets, do not give another dose at this time. Continue with the next dose at the scheduled time.

Hepatitis A Vaccine,"Why get vaccinated against hepatitis A? Hepatitis A vaccine can prevent hepatitis A. Hepatitis A is a serious liver disease. It is usually spread through close, personal contact with an infected person or when a person unknowingly ingests the virus from objects, food, or drinks that are contaminated by small amounts of stool (poop) from an infected person. Most adults with hepatitis A have symptoms, including fatigue, low appetite, stomach pain, nausea, and jaundice (yellow skin or eyes, dark urine, light-colored bowel movements). Most children less than 6 years of age do not have symptoms. A person infected with hepatitis A can transmit the disease to other people even if he or she does not have any symptoms of the disease. Most people who get hepatitis A feel sick for several weeks, but they usually recover completely and do not have lasting liver damage. In rare cases, hepatitis A can cause liver failure and death; this is more common in people older than 50 years and in people with other liver diseases. Hepatitis A vaccine has made this disease much less common in the United States. However, outbreaks of hepatitis A among unvaccinated people still happen. Who should get hepatitis A vaccine and when? Children need 2 doses of hepatitis A vaccine: First dose: 12 through 23 months of age Second dose: at least 6 months after the first dose Infants 6 through 11 months old traveling outside the United States when protection against hepatitis A is recommended should receive 1 dose of hepatitis A vaccine. These children should still get 2 additional doses at the recommended ages for long-lasting protection. Older children and adolescents 2 through 18 years of age who were not vaccinated previously should be vaccinated. Adults who were not vaccinated previously and want to be protected against hepatitis A can also get the vaccine. Hepatitis A vaccine is also recommended for the following people: International travelers Men who have sexual contact with other men People who use injection or non-injection drugs People who have occupational risk for infection People who anticipate close contact with an international adoptee People experiencing homelessness People with HIV People with chronic liver disease In addition, a person who has not previously received hepatitis A vaccine and who has direct contact with someone with hepatitis A should get hepatitis A vaccine as soon as possible and within 2 weeks after exposure. Hepatitis A vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Talk with your health care provider Tell your vaccination provider if the person getting the vaccine: Has had an allergic reaction after a previous dose of hepatitis A vaccine, or has any severe, life-threatening allergies In some cases, your health care provider may decide to postpone hepatitis A vaccination until a future visit. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should be vaccinated if they are at risk for getting hepatitis A. Pregnancy or breastfeeding are not reasons to avoid hepatitis A vaccination. People with minor illnesses, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. People who are moderately or severely ill should usually wait until they recover before getting hepatitis A vaccine. Your health care provider can give you more information. What are the risks from hepatitis A vaccine? soreness or redness where the shot was given, fever, headache, tiredness, or loss of appetite can happen after hepatitis A vaccination. People sometimes faint after medical procedures, including vaccination. Tell your provider if you feel dizzy or have vision changes or ringing in the ears. As with any medicine, there is a very remote chance of a vaccine causing a severe allergic reaction, other serious injury, or death. What if there is a severe reaction? An allergic reaction could occur after the vaccinated person leaves the clinic. If you see signs of a severe allergic reaction (hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, or weakness), call 9-1-1 and get the person to the nearest hospital. For other signs that concern you, call your health care provider. Adverse reactions should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your health care provider will usually file this report, or you can do it yourself. Visit the VAERS website at https://www.vaers.hhs.gov or call 1-800-822-7967 . VAERS is only for reporting reactions, and VAERS staff members do not give medical advice. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is a federal program that was created to compensate people who may have been injured by certain vaccines. Claims regarding alleged injury or death due to vaccination have a time limit for filing, which may be as short as two years. Visit the VICP website at https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation or call 1-800-338-2382 to learn about the program and about filing a claim. How can I learn more? Ask your healthcare provider.

Hepatitis B Vaccine,"Why get vaccinated against hepatitis B? Hepatitis B vaccine can prevent hepatitis B. Hepatitis B is a liver disease that can cause mild illness lasting a few weeks, or it can lead to a serious, lifelong illness. Acute hepatitis B virus infection is a short-term illness that can lead to fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, jaundice (yellow skin or eyes, dark urine, clay-colored bowel movements), and pain in the muscles, joints, and stomach. Chronic hepatitis B virus infection is a long-term illness that occurs when the hepatitis B virus remains in a person's body. Most people who go on to develop chronic hepatitis B do not have symptoms, but it is still very serious and can lead to liver damage (cirrhosis), liver cancer, and death. Chronically infected people can spread hepatitis B virus to others, even if they do not feel or look sick themselves. Hepatitis B is spread when blood, semen, or other body fluid infected with the hepatitis B virus enters the body of a person who is not infected. People can become infected with the virus through: Birth (if a pregnant woman has hepatitis B, their baby can become infected) Sharing items such as razors or toothbrushes with an infected person Contact with the blood or open sores of an infected person Sex with an infected partner Sharing needles, syringes, or other drug-injection equipment Exposure to blood from needlesticks or other sharp instruments Most people who are vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine are immune for life.. Who should receive the hepatitis B vaccine and when? Hepatitis B vaccine is usually given as 2, 3, or 4 shots. Infants should get their first dose of hepatitis B vaccine at birth and will usually complete the series at 6-18 months of age. The birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine is an important part of preventing longterm illness in infants and the spread of hepatitis B in the United States. Children and adolescents younger than 19 years of age who have not yet gotten the vaccine should also be vaccinated. Adults 19 through 59 years old who have not yet gotten the vaccine should also be vaccinated. Adults 60 years of age and older who were not vaccinated previously and are at risk for getting hepatitis B should get the vaccine. Adults 60 years of age and older who were not vaccinated previously,are not at risk for getting hepatitis B and want to be protected against hepatitis B can also get the vaccine. Hepatitis B vaccine may be given as a stand-alone vaccine, or as part of a combination vaccine (a type of vaccine that combines more than one vaccine together into one shot). Hepatitis B vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Talk with your health care provider Tell your vaccination provider if the person getting the vaccine: Has had an allergic reaction after a previous dose of hepatitis B vaccine, or has any severe, life-threatening allergies In some cases, your health care provider may decide to postpone hepatitis B vaccination until a future visit.

Histrelin Implant,"Why is this medication prescribed? Histrelin implant (Vantas) is used to treat the symptoms associated with advanced prostate cancer. Histrelin implant (Supprelin LA) is used to treat central precocious puberty (CPP; a condition causing children to enter puberty too soon, resulting in faster than normal bone growth and development of sexual characteristics) in girls usually between 2 and 8 years of age and in boys usually between 2 and 9 years of age. Histrelin implant is in a class of medications called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists. It works by decreasing the amount of certain hormones in the body. How should this medicine be used? Histrelin comes as an implant (a small, thin, flexible tube containing medication) that is inserted by a doctor on the inside of the upper arm. The doctor will use a medication to numb the arm, make a small cut in the skin, then insert the implant subcutaneously (just under the skin). The cut will be closed with stitches or surgical strips and covered with a bandage. The implant may be inserted every 12 months. After 12 months, the current implant should be removed and can be replaced with another implant to continue treatment. Histrelin implant (Supprelin LA) when used in children with precocious puberty, will likely be stopped by your child's doctor before 11 years of age in girls and 12 years of age in boys. Keep the area around the implant clean and dry for 24 hours after insertion. Do not swim or bathe during this time. Leave the bandage in place for at least 24 hours. If surgical strips are used, leave them on until they fall off on their own. Avoid heavy lifting and physical activity (including heavy play or exercise for children) with the treated arm for 7 days after receiving the implant. Avoid bumping the area around the implant for a few days after insertion. Histrelin may cause an increase in certain hormones in the first few weeks after insertion of the implant. Your doctor will monitor you carefully for any new or worsening symptoms during this time. Sometimes histrelin implant is hard to feel under the skin so the doctor may have to use certain tests, such as ultrasound or MRI scans (radiology techniques designed to show the images of body structures) to find the implant when it is time to remove it. Occasionally, histrelin implant may come out through the original insertion site on its own. You may or may not notice this happening. Call your doctor right away if you think this may have happened to you. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient. Other uses for this medicine This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information. What special precautions should I follow? Before receiving histrelin implant, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to histrelin, goserelin (Zoladex), leuprolide (Eligard, Lupaneta Pack, Lupron), nafarelin (Synarel), triptorelin (Trelstar, Triptodur Kit), anesthetics such as lidocaine (Xylocaine), any other medications, or any of the ingredients in histrelin implant. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients. Tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. tell your doctor if you have a low level of potassium or magnesium in your blood. or if you have or have ever had diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, a prolonged QT interval (a rare heart problem that may cause irregular heartbeat, fainting, or sudden death), cancer that has spread to the spine (backbone), urinary obstruction (blockage that causes difficulty urinating), seizures, brain or blood vessel problems or tumors, mental illness, or heart disease. you should know that histrelin is not to be used in women who are pregnant or can become pregnant.

If you miss an appointment to receive an implant of histrelin or to have histrelin implant removed, you should call your healthcare provider right away to reschedule your appointment. If continuing treatment, the new histrelin implant should be inserted within a few weeks. What side effects can this medication cause? Histrelin implant may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away: bruising, soreness, tingling, or itching at the place where implant was inserted scarring at the place where implant was inserted hot flashes (a sudden wave of mild or intense body heat) tiredness light vaginal bleeding in girls enlarged breasts decrease in size of testicles decreased sexual ability or interest constipation weight gain difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep headache crying, irritability, impatience, anger, aggressive behavior Some side effects can be serious. If you experience any of these symptoms, call your doctor immediately: pain, bleeding, swelling, or redness at the place where implant was inserted hives rash itching difficulty breathing or swallowing bone pain weakness or numbness in the legs pain, burning, or tingling in an arm or leg slow or difficult speech dizziness or fainting chest pain pain in the arms, back, neck, or jaw loss of ability to move difficult urination or can not urinate blood in urine decreased urination unusual bleeding or bruising extreme tiredness loss of appetite pain in the upper right part of the stomach yellowing of the skin or eyes flu-like symptoms depression, thinking about killing yourself or planning or trying to do so seizures Histrelin implant may cause changes in your bones which can increase the chance of broken bones when used for long periods of time. Talk to your doctor about the risks of receiving this medication. In children receiving histrelin implant (Supprelin LA) for precocious puberty, new or worsening symptoms of sexual development may occur during the first few weeks after the insertion of the implant. In girls receiving histrelin implant (Supprelin LA) for precocious puberty, light vaginal bleeding or breast enlargement may occur during the first month of treatment. Histrelin implant may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while receiving this medication.

Human Insulin Injection,"Why is this medication prescribed? Human insulin is used to control blood sugar in people who have type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not make insulin and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) or in people who have type 2 diabetes (condition in which the blood sugar is too high because the body does not produce or use insulin normally) that cannot be controlled with oral medications alone. Human insulin is in a class of medications called hormones. Human insulin is used to take the place of insulin that is normally produced by the body. It works by helping move sugar from the blood into other body tissues where it is used for energy. It also stops the liver from producing more sugar. All of the types of insulin that are available work in this way. The types of insulin differ only in how quickly they begin to work and how long they continue to control blood sugar. Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Using medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease. Your doctor and other healthcare providers will talk to you about the best way to manage your diabetes. How should this medicine be used? Human insulin comes as a solution (liquid) and a suspension (liquid with particles that will settle on standing). to be injected subcutaneously (under the skin). Human insulin is usually injected subcutaneously several times a day, and more than one type of insulin may be needed. Your doctor will tell you which type(s) of insulin to use, how much insulin to use, and how often to inject insulin. Follow these directions carefully. Do not use more or less insulin or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Human insulin (Myxredlin, Humulin R U-100, Novolin R) solution may also be injected intravenously (into a vein) by a doctor or nurse in a healthcare setting. A doctor or nurse will carefully monitor you for side effects. Human insulin controls high blood sugar but does not cure diabetes. Continue to use human insulin even if you feel well. Do not stop using insulin without talking to your doctor. Do not switch to another brand or type of insulin or change the dose of any type of insulin you use without talking to your doctor. Human insulin comes in vials, prefilled disposable dosing devices, and cartridges. The cartridges are designed to be placed in dosing pens. Be sure you know what type of container your insulin comes in and what other supplies, such as needles, syringes, or pens, you will need to inject your medication. Make sure that the name and letter on your insulin are exactly what your doctor prescribed. If your human insulin comes in vials, you will need to use syringes to inject your dose.

Dispose of needles and syringes in a puncture-resistant container. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how to dispose of the puncture-resistant container. Your doctor may tell you to mix two types of insulin in the same syringe. Your doctor will tell you exactly how to draw both types of insulin into the syringe. Follow these directions carefully. Always draw the same type of insulin into the syringe first, and always use the same brand of needles. Never mix more than one type of insulin in a syringe unless you are told to do so by your doctor. Always look at your human insulin before you inject. If you are using a regular human insulin (Humulin R, Novolin R), the insulin should be as clear, colorless, and fluid as water. Do not use this type of insulin if it appears cloudy, thickened, or colored, or if it has solid particles. If you are using an NPH human insulin (Humulin N, Novolin N) or a premixed insulin that contains NPH (Humulin 70/30, Novolin 70/30), the insulin should appear cloudy or milky after you mix it. Do not use these types of insulin if there are clumps in the liquid or if there are solid white particles sticking to the bottom or walls of the bottle.

Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine,"Why get vaccinated? HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccine can prevent infection with some types of human papillomavirus. HPV infections can cause certain types of cancers, including: cervical, vaginal, and vulvar cancer in females penile cancer in males anal cancer in both men and women cancers of tonsils, base of tongue, and back of throat (oropharyngeal cancer) in both men and women HPV infections can also cause anogenital warts. HPV vaccine can prevent over 90% of cancers caused by HPV. HPV is spread through intimate skin-to-skin or sexual contact. HPV infections are so common that nearly all people will get at least one type of HPV at some time in their lives. Most HPV infections go away on their own within 2 years. But sometimes HPV infections will last longer and can cause cancers later in life. What is HPV vaccine? HPV vaccine is routinely routinely recommended for adolescents at 11 or 12 years of age to ensure they are protected before they are exposed to the virus. HPV vaccine may be given beginning at age 9 years and vaccination is recommended for everyone through 26 years of age. HPV vaccine may be given to adults 27 through 45 years of age, based on discussions between the patient and health care provider. Most children who get the first dose before 15 years of age need 2 doses of HPV vaccine. People who get the first dose at or after 15 years of age and younger people with certain immunocompromising conditions need 3 doses. Your health care provider can give you more information. HPV vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Talk with your healthcare provider Tell your vaccination provider if the person getting the vaccine: Has had an allergic reaction after a previous dose of HPV vaccine, or has any severe life-threatening allergies. Is pregnant -- HPV vaccine is not recommended until after pregnancy. In some cases, your health care provider may decide to postpone HPV vaccination until a future visit. People with minor illnesses, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. People who are moderately or severely ill should usually wait until they recover before getting HPV vaccine. Your health care provider can give you more information. What are the risks of a vaccine reaction? Soreness, redness, or swelling where the shot is given can happen after HPV vaccination. Fever or headache can happen after HPV vaccination. People sometimes faint after medical procedures, including vaccination. Tell your doctor if you feel dizzy, or have vision changes or ringing in the ears. As with any medication, there is a very remote chance of a vaccine causing a severe allergic reaction, other serious injury, or death. What if there is a serious problem? An allergic reaction could occur after the vaccinated person leaves the clinic. If you see signs of a severe allergic reaction (hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, or weakness), call 9-1-1 and get the person to the nearest hospital. For other signs that concern you, call your health care provider. Adverse reactions should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your health care provider will usually file this report, or you can do it yourself. Visit the VAERS website at http://www.vaers.hhs.gov or call 1-800-822-7967 . VAERS is only for reporting reactions, and VAERS staff members do not give medical advice . The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is a federal program that was created to compensate people who may have been injured by certain vaccines. Claims regarding alleged injury or death due to vaccination have a time limit for filing, which may be as short as two years. Visit the VICP website at http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation or call 1-800-338-2382 to learn about the program and about filing a claim. How can I learn more? Ask your healthcare provider.

Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine (Cervarix),"Notice: This medication is no longer marketed in the United States. This vaccine will no longer be available once current supplies are gone. What is HPV? Genital human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted virus in the United States. More than half of sexually active men and women are infected with HPV at some time in their lives. About 20 million Americans are currently infected, and about 6 million more get infected each year. HPV is usually spread through sexual contact. Most HPV infections don't cause any symptoms, and go away on their own. But HPV can cause cervical cancer in women. Cervical cancer is the 2nd leading cause of cancer deaths among women around the world. In the United States, about 10,000 women get cervical cancer every year and about 4,000 are expected to die from it. HPV is also associated with several less common cancers, such as vaginal and vulvar cancers in women and other types of cancer in both men and women. It can also cause genital warts and warts in the throat. There is no cure for HPV infection, but some of the problems it causes can be treated. HPV vaccineâWhy get vaccinated? HPV vaccine is important because it can prevent most cases of cervical cancer in females, if it is given before a person is exposed to the virus. Protection from HPV vaccine is expected to be long-lasting. But vaccination is not a substitute for cervical cancer screening. Women should still get regular Pap tests. The vaccine you are getting is one of two HPV vaccines that can be given to prevent cervical cancer. It is given to females only. The other vaccine may be given to both males and females. It can also prevent most genital warts. It has also been shown to prevent some vaginal, vulvar and anal cancers. Who should get this HPV vaccine and when? Routine Vaccination HPV vaccine is recommended for girls 11 or 12 years of age. It may be given to girls starting at age 9. Why is HPV vaccine given to girls at this age? It is important for girls to get HPV vaccine before their first sexual contact, because they won't have been exposed to human papillomavirus. Once a girl or woman has been infected with the virus, the vaccine might not work as well or might not work at all. Catch-up Vaccination The vaccine is also recommended for girls and women 13 through 26 years of age who did not get all 3 doses when they were younger. HPV vaccine is given as a 3-dose series 1st Dose: Now 2nd Dose: 1 to 2 months after Dose 1 3rd Dose: 6 months after Dose 1 Additional (booster) doses are not recommended. HPV vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Some people should not get HPV vaccine or should wait Anyone who has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to any component of HPV vaccine, or to a previous dose of HPV vaccine, should not get the vaccine. Tell your doctor if the person getting vaccinated has any severe allergies, including an allergy to latex. HPV vaccine is not recommended for pregnant women. However, receiving HPV vaccine when pregnant is not a reason to consider terminating the pregnancy. Women who are breastfeeding may get the vaccine.Any woman who learns she was pregnant when she got this HPV vaccine is encouraged to contact the manufacturer's HPV in pregnancy registry at 888-452-9622 . This will help us learn how pregnant women respond to the vaccine. People who are mildly ill when a dose of HPV vaccine is planned can still be vaccinated. People with a moderate or severe illness should wait until they are better. What are the risks from this vaccine? This HPV vaccine has been in use around the world for several years and has been very safe. However, any medicine could possibly cause a serious problem, such as a severe allergic reaction. The risk of any vaccine causing a serious injury, or death, is extremely small. Life-threatening allergic reactions from vaccines are very rare. If they do occur, it would be within a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination. Several mild to moderate problems are known to occur with HPV vaccine. These do not last long and go away on their own. Reactions where the shot was given: pain (about 9 people in 10); redness or swelling (about 1 person in 2) Other mild reactions: fever of 99.5 Â°F or higher (about 1 person in 8); headache or fatigue (about 1 person in 2); nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain (about 1 person in 4); muscle or joint pain (up to 1 person in 2) Fainting: brief fainting spells and related symptoms (such as jerking movements) can happen after any medical procedure, including vaccination. Sitting or lying down for about 15 minutes after a vaccination can help prevent fainting and injuries caused by falls. Tell your doctor if the patient feels dizzy or light-headed, or has vision changes or ringing in the ears. Like all vaccines, HPV vaccines will continue to be monitored for unusual or severe problems. What if there is a severe reaction? What should I look for? Serious allergic reactions including rash; swelling of the hands and feet, face, or lips; and breathing difficulty. What should I do? Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away. Tell the doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given. Ask your doctor to report the reaction by filing a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) form. Or you can file this report through the VAERS website at http://www.vaers.hhs.gov , or by calling 1-800-822-7967 . VAERS does not provide medical advice.
