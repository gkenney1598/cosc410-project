Aspirin Rectal,"Important warning: Aspirin can cause serious bleeding, especially in the stomach or brain, and should not be given to children or teenagers with viral illnesses such as flu or chickenpox due to the risk of Reye’s syndrome. Do not use if you have active bleeding, a bleeding disorder, recent stomach or intestinal ulcers, severe uncontrolled high blood pressure, or if you are allergic to aspirin or other NSAIDs. Why is this medication prescribed? Rectal aspirin is used to reduce fever, relieve mild to moderate pain, and decrease inflammation when oral dosing is not possible; in some cases a clinician may use it to reduce blood clot risk, but this requires specific dosing and medical supervision. How should this medicine be used? Use exactly as directed on the label or by your clinician. Wash your hands, remove the suppository wrapper, moisten the tip with water if needed, lie on your side, gently insert the suppository pointed end first into the rectum (adults generally about 2.5 cm or 1 inch), then remain lying for a few minutes to keep it from slipping out. Do not use more often or for longer than directed. Do not give to children or teens with a fever from viral illness. What special precautions should I follow? Tell your clinician about asthma, nasal polyps, stomach or intestinal ulcers or bleeding, GERD, kidney or liver disease, gout, anemia, low platelet count, G6PD deficiency, pregnancy or breastfeeding, and all medicines you use, especially blood thinners (warfarin, DOACs), other NSAIDs, SSRIs/SNRIs, corticosteroids, methotrexate, and alcohol. Stop and seek medical help for signs of bleeding (vomiting blood, black stools), allergic reaction, severe abdominal pain, or ringing in the ears with dizziness. Avoid using with other products that contain aspirin or salicylate. What special dietary instructions should I follow? Limit or avoid alcohol because it increases bleeding risk. Keep well hydrated; otherwise there are no specific dietary restrictions for the rectal form. What should I do if I forget a dose? If you use it on a schedule, insert it when you remember unless it is almost time for the next dose; if so, skip the missed dose. Do not use two doses at once.

Common effects include local rectal irritation or burning, nausea, or upset stomach. Serious effects include stomach or intestinal bleeding, easy bruising or bleeding, ringing in the ears or hearing changes, dizziness, severe allergic reaction, and in children or teens with viral illness, Reye’s syndrome (persistent vomiting, confusion, behavior changes)."

People who can become pregnant must use two effective forms of contraception for at least 1 month before starting, during treatment, and for at least 3 years after the last dose; have regular pregnancy tests; and must not drink alcohol during treatment and for 2 months after stopping because alcohol can convert acitretin to etretinate, which stays in the body much longer and greatly extends the risk of birth defects.
